            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>FIRST PART.</head>
               <p>We are all of us willing to believe our eyes; and truly we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe them, eſpecially when all mens eyes agree, and in all times &amp; places give the ſame information to our underſtandings. Not that I think it is impoſſible for the Almighty to deceive the eyes of all men by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant miracle of his Omnipotence; but that I have good reaſon to ſuppoſe he uſes methods more conformable to reaſonable nature. One great occaſion of men's thinking that their ſenſes are impoſed upon, is but a falſe perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that when they ſee the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> they muſt believe the outward form, the ſurface, &amp; the qualities, which we ſee, touch, &amp; taſt, to be the true <hi>Body</hi> &amp; <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> If this were ſo, they would have reaſon to be jealous of their ſenſes being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted. But if theſe people would reflect, that all this outward form, the ſurface, and the qualities, which we obſerve, are really in all reſpects the very ſame as they are repreſented to our ſenſes: that they are not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62850:5"/>by us to be the true Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but only the coat which cloaths it, the curtain which is drawn before it, the veil which shrouds it and hides it from our ſenſes: that when we fall down on our knees to adore our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whom we firmly believe to be really and ſubſtantially preſent by a miracle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible and imperceptible to all our ſenſes, we do not adore the coat which cloaths him, nor the curtain which is drawn before him, nor the veil which shrouds &amp; hides him from us: we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adore the God of our Salvation, who in the myſtery of the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hid his Divinity in flesh, &amp; in the myſtery of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> hides his flesh &amp; blood under the forms of bread &amp; wine: <hi>Verily,</hi> ſays the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>c,</hi> 45. <hi>v.</hi> 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou art a God that hideſt thy ſelf, O God of Iſrael, the Saviour.</hi> If people would but leiſurely reflect, that all which they perceive by any of their ſenſes is really and truly the ſame as they perceive it; that Faith dos not oblige them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the contrary, but only to believe that under the ſuperficies of theſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62850:5"/>outward forms the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are hid miraculouſly, &amp; conceal'd from all their ſenſes: Then they would eaſily conclude that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is not contrary to ſenſe. My word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone perhaps has not ſufficient credit with you: you may hear <hi>S. Anſelm,</hi> in the end of the eleventh Century, after the condemnation of <hi>Berenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi> In the 1. ch. of his Tract <hi>de Sacramento Altaris,</hi> he plainly ſays, <hi>That ſimilitude of bread which upon the Altar appears to our corporeal eyes, conſiderd in it ſelf, is not the body of our Lord.</hi> No, no: you may believe your eyes, that all the exteriour forms of bread are truly there; 'tis only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to believe that the body of our Lord is really containd &amp; hidden under them. And thus the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> expreſſely declares in the 1. ch. of the 13. <hi>Seſſion;</hi> not that the <hi>ſenſible things</hi> themſelves are truly the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but that <hi>under them</hi> his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>is containd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis written in the 1. of <hi>Samuel;</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>c.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Men look upon the outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, but God looks upon the heart.</hi> In like manner, our Senſes only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62850:6"/>the outward appearances of their objects; but our Underſtanding, by which we are made to the image of God, is the onely Faculty which can diſcern the inward ſubſtance. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked notion of <hi>ſubſiſtent Being</hi> cannot be perceiv'd by any ſenſe, becauſe it neither has dimenſion, motion, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, figure, colour, nor any of thoſe modifications which affect our ſenſes. The qualities and modes of matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept our ſight, no ſenſe can pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the ſuperficies of it, &amp; diſcern the nakedneſs of ſubſtance through the cloaths it wears; we neither ſee it, nor feel it, more than we ſee or feel the ſubſtance of the Soul which animates our Body.</p>
               <p>Now, I muſt needs acknowledge that, if when we receive the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> we ſaw it round, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievd it ſquare; if we ſaw it white, &amp; yet believd it black; if we felt it rough, &amp; yet believd it ſmooth; if we felt it dry, &amp; yet believd it moiſt; if we taſted ſweetneſs in it, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievd it bitter; No man could then deny but that our <hi>Faith</hi> would teach things evidently contrary to what our <hi>Senſes</hi> tell us. But, as the caſe ſtands
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62850:6"/>with us in this article, I never yet could ſee how any thing, but igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, can poſſibly excuſe all thoſe who flap us ore the mouth with the abſurdity of contradicting all our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. We really believe, the ſuperficies or outward form is round and white, juſt as we ſee it; if we feel it rough and dry, we take it to be ſuch; and when we taſt it ſweet, we do not queſtion but it is ſo. We firmly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any heſitation, believe all that our Senſes repreſent unto us; we declare to all the world that we believe our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; we live &amp; dy in a perſuaſion that in this myſtery our Senſes tell us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what's true; And yet ſome people have the face to tell us, that we contradict our ſenſes. A ſtrange world it is, we live in now, that makes no conſcience of ſaying any thing!</p>
               <p>I know very well, you'l readily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that after conſecration we ſee the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of bread, and we believe the <hi>Subſtance</hi> is not there: is not this, contradicting of our <hi>Senſes?</hi> I grant, that after conſecration we ſee the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> as plainly as we did before; but this I flatly deny, that any man ever ſaw the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of bread either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62850:7"/>or after. 'Tis true; moſt men, who do not underſtand <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> are apt to think that when they ſee bread lie before them, they ſee the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of it: They never imagine that there is as much difference betwixt ſeeing <hi>bread,</hi> &amp; ſeeing the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of bread, as there is betwixt ſeeing <hi>ſubſtance</hi> with all its cloaths on, and ſeeing of it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. When they ſee the length, breadth, depth, the figure, texture, colour, of the parts of bread, they think they ſee the <hi>ſubſtance;</hi> and 'tis no wonder, that they are miſtaken, becauſe they do not underſtand what <hi>ſubſtance</hi> is. But if they would go to ſchool to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or <hi>Carteſius,</hi> the two chief Maſters of the old &amp; new Philoſophy, the Firſt would reach them, that when they think they ſee or feel the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of any body, they only ſee &amp; feel the <hi>accidents,</hi> the quantity &amp; qualities that cover it; The ſecond would eaſily inform them, and let them know they only ſee &amp; feel the ſuperficies &amp; modes of matter, which may remain the ſame, to all intents &amp; purpoſes, and make the ſame impreſſion upon our ſenſes, although the entity of matter be entirely chang'd.

               <p>Some of my Auditory may perhaps be a little ſurpriſed to hear ſo much <hi>Philoſophy</hi> deliverd in a pulpit, whence they uſually expect the Law of God &amp; <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctrine. If without <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi> we cannot find the way to Heaven, what will become of all thoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who never found the way to ſchool? Pray give me leave: There are a great many <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (let them be as ignorant as you pleaſe, eſpecially in matters of <hi>Philoſophy</hi>) who never the leſs think they are wiſe enough to judge the greateſt myſteries and ſecrets of it: And when they hear the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> affirm, that, in the Euchariſt, the interiour <hi>ſubſtances</hi> of bread &amp; wine are chang'd into the body &amp; blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remaining (but the outward forms) of bread &amp; wine; in ſtead of receiving humbly the <hi>Chriſtian Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> propoſes, they immediatly take upon them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it as an errour, &amp; cry it down
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62850:8"/>as a ridiculous abſurdity which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts our ſenſes. All this while they never conſider how little it becomes them to pretend to judge of things, they do not underſtand. Tell them that in the principles both of the old &amp; new <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> we never ſee the nakedneſs of any ſubſtance what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, but only the outward forms which hide it from us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if the <hi>Almighty</hi> have a mind to change the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> only, not the <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,</hi> we may watch him as nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly as we pleaſe, &amp; never diſcover any alteration, becauſe all that our ſenſes can perceive, remains the ſame; and as, before the ſubſtance was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly chang'd, we could not ſee it; ſo, after 'tis miraculouſly chang'd, we cannot miſs it. Talk to them of theſe notions in the plaineſt terms you can, they'l ask you what you mean. &amp; wonder what you would be at. They neither know the nature of the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> nor the <hi>accidents;</hi> they know not whether <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> be contrary to ſenſe or no; and yet they ſtill will tell a man, it contradicts their ſenſes. 'Tis very hard, in ſuch a caſe as this, if they who do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62850:9"/>
                  <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> may tell us, we deny our ſenſes; and they who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, may not be allow'd to tell them fairly, they are very much miſtaken. Miſtakes in matters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are dangerous: And certainly ſo much <hi>Philoſophy</hi> as is needfull to ſet us right, cannot but be allowable when ſuch miſtakes as theſe proceed from want of underſtanding it.</p>
               <p>I shall conclude this part of my diſcourſe, with shewing, in as eaſie terms as the matter will bear, that tis impoſſible for any of our ſenſes to give evidence againſt our faith of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> If we believd that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> were a <hi>ſenſible change,</hi> a <hi>change</hi> of any thing that is <hi>ſenſible</hi> in the bread &amp; wine; then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, our ſenſes being judges of ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things might eaſily give evidence againſt our faith: They might depoſe, that nothing ſenſible is chang'd, but that all things ſenſible remain the ſame as formerly they were; and no man could deny but that our <hi>Faith</hi> would contradict our <hi>Senſes.</hi> But, on the contrary, if we do not believe that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is a ſenſible change; if we believe no change of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62850:9"/>any thing which is ſenſible; then, truly, our ſenſes, not being judges of inſenſible things, cannot give evidence againſt us; they cannot depoſe that no inſenſible thing is chang'd, becauſe inſenſible matters fall not within their cognizance; and therefore, whether they are chang'd or not, is more than they can tell. If there should happen a diſpute concerning difference of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, whether they are chang'd or not? Would you remit it to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitration of five blind men? Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diſpute betwixt us, is about the <hi>inſenſible</hi> difference of <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> whether it be chang'd or not, How can our <hi>ſenſes</hi> give their ſentiment one way or other, either for it, or againſt it?</p>
               <p>This argument is ſo convincing, that it will not bear the leaſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a ſolid <hi>Anſwer;</hi> and withall ſo plain, that any man without <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy</hi> may clearly underſtand it. To which I shall only add a word or two more, to put a ſtop to all the cavills which may poſſibly ariſe from the diverſity of ſchoolmen's fancies.</p>
               <p>Tis evident that the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> by the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62850:10"/>to be chang'd in the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> dos not underſtand any thing that is <hi>ſenſible</hi> in bread &amp; wine. The <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> in the 2. <hi>Canon</hi> of the 13. <hi>Seſſion,</hi> ſuppoſes as a certain &amp; undoubted truth, that all <hi>things ſenſible remain</hi> the ſame; <hi>manentibus ſpeciebus panis &amp; vini:</hi> And, in the 1. ch. of the ſame <hi>Seſſion,</hi> tells us, that the body &amp; blood of <hi>Chriſt are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd under</hi> them, <hi>ſub ſpecie illarum rerum ſenſibilium.</hi> Tis true, the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> dos not offer to define what <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> is; it dos not tell us what it underſtands by <hi>ſubſtance;</hi> it meddles not with definitions of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> but only definitions of <hi>Faith,</hi> determining what <hi>Truths</hi> were firſt deliver'd to the <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>Chriſt</hi> &amp; his <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> But, though we know not in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar what 'twas the <hi>Council</hi> meant by <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> This we know for certain, that it meant not any of thoſe <hi>ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things,</hi> but only that inſenſible <hi>ſubſiſtent Being</hi> which is hidden <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> them: And this is enough to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence all diſputes about the Evidence of Senſe. Let, who will, tell us that the <hi>ſubſtances</hi> of bread &amp; wine are <hi>ſenſible,</hi> we always shall have this to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62850:10"/>ſay, That if by <hi>ſubſtance</hi> they mean ſomething which is <hi>ſenſible,</hi> the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> dos not mean the ſame; They mean one ſort of <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> The <hi>Council</hi> means another; &amp; therefore all their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments from evidence of ſenſe are every one miſplac'd; they are levell'd againſt a chimerical <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of their own invention, and not againſt that which the <hi>Council</hi> has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd. In a word, if any <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> be contrary to ſenſe, Let them look to't; we are not at all concern'd in the matter; ſuch a <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is not <hi>ours</hi> but <hi>theirs.</hi> I humbly recommend this to your ſerious thoughts, &amp; undertake to prove, that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is not contrary to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> in the ſecond part of my <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</hi>

All this proceeds from nothing but a ſecret pride or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which make us willing to ſuppoſe that we are wiſer than we are; that we comprehend the ſecret <hi>Natures</hi> of things; underſtand clearly the <hi>eſſentiall conſtitution</hi> of their <hi>Beings;</hi> ſee evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the <hi>attributes</hi> appropriated to them, &amp; all the qualities irreconcilea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly repugnant to their natures.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62850:11"/>in our arbitrary notions, from whence we draw ſo eaſily theſe bold Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.

               <p>Tis ſtrange to ſee, when once our minds are prepoſſeſst with an averſion from any doctrine, how blind we are in our enquiries, how partial &amp; une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual in our judgments.

               <p>The Common <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi> is: That we are better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the <hi>Nature</hi> of a <hi>Body,</hi> than of a <hi>Spirit. Bodies</hi> are the familiar ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our <hi>Senſes,</hi> and if we do not know the <hi>Nature</hi> of them, we know nothing at all: But our Notions of a <hi>Spirit</hi> are ſo imperfect, that it is an argument of wiſdom, rather than weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to ſubmit our judgments in things we cannot underſtand.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs; if we conſider only the ſuperficial knowledge of <hi>Bodies.</hi> our <hi>Mathematicians</hi> meaſure very skillfully their three dimenſions, we demonſtrate many ingenious Truths, both uſefull &amp; delightfull, and have knowledge enough to make us proud: But, if we conſider the inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution or nature of theſe very ſame bodies which we meaſure ſo skillful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we shall ſoon find we have igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance enough to humble us. Tis an eaſie thing to tell me the length of a <hi>Line,</hi> &amp; to meaſure it by ſo many inches; But, who can tell me what this line is made of? is it a chain of indiviſible points immediatly linkt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? or is it compos'd of parts which may be really divided leſſe &amp;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62850:14"/>leſſe, for ever &amp; ever, world without end? The firſt is an unconceivable piece of <hi>nonſenſe:</hi> And the ſecond is a <hi>Labyrinth</hi> which when our <hi>Reaſon</hi> enters it can never find the way out. What are we more acquainted with, or what is more familiar to us, than <hi>Light</hi> &amp; <hi>Colour?</hi> And yet no body can tell certainly what they are: The Learned have diſputed ſome thouſands of years about it, &amp; are not agreed upon the point. We <hi>ſee;</hi> and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our eyes; And nothing is more certain than that we do ſo: Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs when we come to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ſtrictly, by what means, &amp; <hi>how</hi> this operation is perform'd; we are as much in the dark as if we were ſtark blind. We <hi>move</hi> from place to place; we meaſure our <hi>motion,</hi> as to time &amp; ſpace; we know very well, whether one motion be longer or shorter, whether it be ſwifter or ſlower, than another: And yet when our <hi>Natural Philoſophers</hi> enquire into the nature of this <hi>Motion,</hi> nothing is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain: The greateſt Wits have ever been at a loſſe when they pretend to explicate how <hi>Motion</hi> is poſſible; And <hi>Zeno's</hi> argument has never been clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62850:14"/>anſwerd. In the ſame manner, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though nothing is more certain than that all the <hi>Bodies,</hi> which we ever were acquainted with, have three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions, <hi>length, bredth,</hi> &amp; <hi>depth;</hi> yet if we ſtrictly enquire into the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall notion of a <hi>Body</hi> by which it differs from a <hi>Spirit,</hi> we shall find it not ſo eaſie to determine, but that this matter is very dark, as well as others I haue mentiond. To make it as clear as I can, I ſuppoſe; 1. that there is no <hi>ſubſtance</hi> but what is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>body</hi> or a <hi>Spirit;</hi> 2. that no <hi>Spirit</hi> either has <hi>dimenſions,</hi> or is <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable</hi> of having them: From whence I conclude; 1. that every <hi>ſubſtance</hi> which either has <hi>dimenſions</hi> or is <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable</hi> of having them, is a <hi>body</hi> and no <hi>ſpirit;</hi> 2. that <hi>actual dimenſions</hi> are not the <hi>eſſence</hi> of a <hi>body,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Idea</hi> of them preſuppoſes the <hi>capacity</hi> of having them, &amp; this <hi>Capacity</hi> is the firſt <hi>Idea</hi> by which a <hi>Body</hi> differs from a <hi>Spirit.</hi> The <hi>Queſtion</hi> is; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 'tis poſſible for a <hi>Body</hi> to be ſtript naked of all its dimenſions, &amp; ſubſiſt without them?</p>
               <p>Tis no wonder, there is ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion

The vulgar part of mankind never conſider what a <hi>Body</hi> is made of, any farther than they can either <hi>uſe</hi> it, or make <hi>money</hi> of it. So that a <hi>Body</hi> miraculouſly ſtript of all its dimenſions, being neither meaſurable, nor uſefull, nor marketable, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly (in the language of <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians,</hi> &amp; of the <hi>Vulgar</hi>) no <hi>Body</hi> at all. All the trade they drive with <hi>Bodies</hi> is by weight &amp; meaſure; and therefore 'tis no wonder, if by the word <hi>Body,</hi> they conceive nothing but <hi>Dimenſions.</hi> Theſe people, by their own confeſſion, have only a ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial knowledg of a <hi>Body:</hi> They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare frankly, they know nothing of it but the outſide. <hi>Philoſophers</hi> are the onely men that conſider the <hi>inſide</hi> of <hi>Nature:</hi> They are not content to gaze
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62850:15"/>
                  <hi>without;</hi> but endeavour to enter the very <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> &amp; diſcover what lies <hi>hid</hi> behind the <hi>Veil.</hi> And theſe men, if the reſt of the world would give them a fair hearing &amp; not make too much noiſe, would ſoon decide the difficulty. The Queſtion is (putting the Caſe, that a <hi>Body</hi> were diveſted of its <hi>natural dimenſions</hi>) whether the <hi>Remainder</hi> would be ſtill a <hi>Body,</hi> or not?</p>
               <p>Tis evident that, in the <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> or <hi>Vulgar</hi> ſenſe, it would not be ſo: Neither is that the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Queſtion.</hi> We do not ask, whether the <hi>Dimenſions</hi> would <hi>remain</hi> when they are <hi>gone?</hi> We know very well, it implies a moſt manifeſt <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</hi> Our enquiry is only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of a <hi>natural Body,</hi> that is, of a <hi>Subſtance</hi> which is not a <hi>Spirit.</hi> And, without all doubt, when we ſuppoſe nothing to be taken from a <hi>Body</hi> but its <hi>actual dimenſions,</hi> That which we conceive to remain is ſtill a <hi>natural Body,</hi> becauſe 'tis certainly no <hi>Spirit:</hi> it ſtill retains a reall <hi>capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of having its natural dimenſions,</hi> and this <hi>Capacity</hi> is abſolutely repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the <hi>nature</hi> of a <hi>Spirit.</hi> Thus
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62850:16"/>you plainly ſee, that the <hi>Suppoſition,</hi> we talk of, dos not deſtroy the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of a natural <hi>Body;</hi> it dos not imply any <hi>Contradiction;</hi> And therefore dos not leave any reaſonable ground of denying the poſſibility of it. Men may fancy what they pleaſe; and will ever do ſo, without asking their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours leave; There's no remedy for it: But, after all, He muſt be a bold man that undertakes to demonſtrate the abſolute impoſſibility of the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi> I ſpeak of.</p>
               <p>To return to my argument, I would now gladly enquire; ſince, in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation</hi> and <hi>Trinity,</hi> it is no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of weakneſs, but of wiſdom, to ſubmit our judgments; Why is it not ſo in this? If the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> &amp; the <hi>divine Perſons,</hi> are objects ſo <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi> and ſo much out of our reach, that it dos not become us to dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize in matters belonging to them: Pray, tell me what acquaintance have we with a <hi>Body</hi> diveſted of all its natural dimenſions, &amp; reduced to the condition of a <hi>Spirit?</hi> All our <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical</hi> &amp; <hi>Vulgar</hi> notions, of which we are ſo confident, are (in this caſe) ſo far from giving us any light, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62850:16"/>they are rather like ſo much duſt in our eyes that hinders us from ſeeing. Tis no part of our Faith, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Sacrament has all his natural dimenſions: if it were, Then indeed theſe Notions might furnish ſomething to ſay againſt it. One might argue, as <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi> dos againſt <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt as to his corporal preſence could not, at the ſame time, be in the Sun &amp; Moon, &amp; on the Croſs.</hi> But, in our preſent <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> all our experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal knowledge of a <hi>Body</hi> is out of doors; And all our pretended demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations are meer nonſenſe. Tis evident, that without local extenſion a <hi>Body</hi> is neither <hi>confin'd</hi> by being in <hi>one</hi> place, nor <hi>divided</hi> by being in <hi>two:</hi> And 'tis as eaſie a matter to meaſure a <hi>line</hi> without <hi>length,</hi> an <hi>angle</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>ſpace,</hi> or a <hi>circle</hi> without <hi>diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> as it is to find work for <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical</hi> concluſions in a <hi>Body</hi> without <hi>dimenſions.</hi>

               <p>Some will ingenuouſly confeſs, they do not think that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is impoſſible; but they are apt to think it is incredible, either that <hi>Chriſt</hi> should work ſo great a miracle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out neceſſity, or humble himſelf to

                  <hi>O man,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>who art thou that replyeſt againſt God?</hi> His <hi>Goodneſs</hi> is as infinite as his <hi>Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;</hi> and tis as great an inſolence to give laws to the one, as to give limits to the other. He ſeems to value more the reputation of his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> than of his <hi>Power;</hi> and if we trace his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence throughout the Conduct of the Moral World, we cannot but obſerve that He has taken much more pains to shew his goodneſs than to shew his greatneſs. In the <hi>Creation</hi> of the Univerſe He shewd his Power: But what was that to the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God?</hi> All the Perfections of Creatures diſappear, &amp; shrink to nothing, when compar'd to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of their great Creatour; And the whole Univerſe, by which God shews his Greatneſs, is nothing in compariſon of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> by whom he shews his Kindneſs to us. You all are ſcandaliz'd at their ingratitude, who will not give God thanks for this ineſtimable favour; will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he has been ſo good, ſo
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62850:17"/>mercifull, ſo kind. They ſay, that though 't were poſſible it is not credible that God should work ſo great a miracle without neceſſity; that there was none at all for him to come him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in perſon; that he might have ſent a holy man for our inſtruction, he might have charg'd him with our ſins, he might have pardon'd both him and us without condign ſatisfaction: Tis true, The <hi>Scripture</hi> ſeems to ſpeak in plain terms the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Chriſt; but yet may bear another ſenſe, and may admit a much more credible interpretation. If a <hi>Socinian</hi> should urge this argument againſt you, you would ſcarce have patience to hear him. Why then do you object the ſame againſt the myſtery of <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation?</hi> Why do you tell us, 'tis incredible that God should work ſo great a miracle without neceſſity? that the real preſence is not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary? that the <hi>Sacrament</hi> might have ſufficient efficacy to give grace without it? Why do you ſay, that though the <hi>Scripture</hi> plainly ſpeaks in favour of this myſtery, yet we are not obliged to take it in the literal ſenſe? that the figurative ſenſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62850:18"/>is much more eaſie to conceive, &amp; therefore is a much more credible interpretation? O <hi>man,</hi> ſays <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ah! my dear Jeſus!</hi> it grieves my heart to ſee, that thou haſt <hi>made</hi> thy <hi>ſelf of no reputation,</hi> by taking upon thee the form of bread; and that, by <hi>being found in fashion as</hi> bread, thou haſt humbled thy ſelf ſo low, as to be ſtill <hi>deſpiſed, rejected,</hi> &amp; <hi>diſeſteem'd by men.</hi> But yet it is a comfort to me, when I think that thy moſt ſacred <hi>Body</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal &amp; impaſſible; thou doſt not now <hi>bear</hi> all <hi>our griefs,</hi> &amp; <hi>carry</hi> all <hi>our ſorrows;</hi> thou art not <hi>wounded</hi> there <hi>for our tranſgreſſions,</hi> nor <hi>bruiſed for our iniquities;</hi> thou art not capable of being now <hi>afflicted</hi> &amp; <hi>oppreſſt.</hi> Compute then, if you pleaſe, all the indignities the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is ſubject to; and by the way take notice that

               <p>That all men do not rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the word of God in <hi>Scripture,</hi> is a Truth which no man can deny that has a grain of common ſenſe. Every man plainly ſees how in our Nation the reformed religion is crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled into multitudes of Sects, as oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in many things to one another, as they are to us. They all read <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> follow <hi>Scripture,</hi> prove &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove what they pleaſe by <hi>Scripture;</hi> and all the while, as they agree in nothing more than in the <hi>book,</hi> ſo they agree in nothing leſſe than in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62850:21"/>the <hi>ſenſe.</hi> No man is bound to think his neighbour, or the whole <hi>Church,</hi> wiſer than himſelf; but every man has as much liberty, as he has vanity, to think himſelf the beſt interpreter of <hi>Scripture</hi> for himſelf. Amidſt this great confuſion, what wonder is it, if we find that many, with as little modeſty as reaſon, face us down, that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation is repugnant to plain words of holy Scripture?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Text, which firſt appears againſt us, is in the 3. ch. of the <hi>Acts</hi> where it is ſaid of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>v.</hi> 21.</note> 
                  <hi>the Heavens muſt receive</hi> him <hi>till the time of reſtitution of all things:</hi> whence it plainly follows, that his body is in heaven, &amp; muſt be in heaven till the time of reſtitution, that is, till the day of judgment. All this is very true; and we believe it as much as any of our neighbours. But how comes this Text to contradict his real preſence in the <hi>Sacrament?</hi> The <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us that our Saviours Body is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but where dos it teach us that it is not at the ſame time upon earth? Where dos it plainly ſay, No miracle can make one body at the ſame time
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62850:22"/>be in ſeveral places? Shew us but this deliverd plainly in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and then wee'l grant that <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is repugnant to it. Some, upon this occaſion, produce the <hi>Angel's</hi> words, who in the laſt chapter of <hi>S. Matthew,</hi> told the women at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, <hi>He is not here, for He is riſen:</hi> where the <hi>Angel</hi> ſeems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that becauſe his body was in another place, therefore it was not in that place. All the whole ſtreſs of this argument depends upon a word of ſo little moment, that the laſt of <hi>S. Mark</hi> quite leaves it out; &amp; the laſt of <hi>S. Luke</hi> not only leaves it cut, but puts another in the place: in <hi>S. Mark,</hi> the <hi>Angel</hi> ſays, <hi>He is riſen, He is not here;</hi> in <hi>S. Luke</hi> he ſays, <hi>He is not here, but is riſen.</hi> But however, if the <hi>Angel's</hi> Reaſoning in <hi>S. Matthew</hi> muſt be ſo much magnified; when they have made the beſt they can of it, 'twill amount to neither more nor leſs than this; <hi>He is not here,</hi> becauſe <hi>he is riſen,</hi> that is, He is not here <hi>becauſe</hi> he is gone from hence; which infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is not a jot the worſe, although we should ſuppoſe that the ſame body may be, at the ſame time, in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62850:22"/>places. Let us ſuppoſe his Body at the ſame time, if you pleaſe, in millions of places; yet, if it be true, that <hi>he is riſen</hi> &amp; gone from hence, it follows evidently that <hi>he is not here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Text is found in the 3. ch. of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the <hi>Coloſſians;</hi> where he gives both them &amp; us good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; bids us<note n="*" place="bottom">

Did not our Saviour preach the ſame to his Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles? And yet he lived amongſt them upon Earth.</p>
               <p>The third Text lies before us in the 14. of <hi>S. Mark,</hi> where our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer makes a plain Antitheſis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him &amp; the poor, compares

Therefore he is not come yet: Very true: The Lord's Day is not come; the Day of judgment is not come; and onely God knows when it will come: But, is it therefore evident that in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> there is no <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> no <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> becauſe the Day of judgment is not come?

               <p>The two laſt Texts as they have moſt appearance ſo they have the leaſt of ſubſtance when they are examin'd. <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſays in his 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. ch.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>v.</hi> 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, &amp; ſo let him eat of that bread:</hi> Our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſays, in the 26. ch. of <hi>S. Math.</hi>

                  <hi>I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the Vine:</hi> Both of them ſpeak thus after conſecration; Both of them call it <hi>bread</hi> &amp; <hi>wine;</hi> And therefore, after conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it ſtill remains true <hi>bread</hi> &amp; <hi>wine.</hi> You ſee how fairly I propoſe the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and now I humbly beg your beſt attention to the Anſwer. <hi>S. Paul</hi> dos not ſay, <hi>This is Bread:</hi> Our <hi>Saviour</hi> dos not ſay, <hi>This is Wine: S. Paul</hi> dos
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62850:25"/>not contradict our <hi>Saviour;</hi> nor dos our <hi>Saviour</hi> contradict himſelf: Why then do they call it <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine?</hi> The Anſwer is obvious; Not becauſe it was bread &amp; wine then, but becauſe it was bread &amp; wine before. Nothing is more familiar in <hi>Scripture</hi> than this way of ſpeaking. <hi>S. Iohn</hi> in the 9. ch. of his <hi>Ghoſpel,</hi> relating the miraculous cure of the man that was born <hi>blind,</hi> tells us in the 7. v. <hi>He went his way &amp; washt &amp; came ſeeing:</hi> and yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the 17. v. he calls him <hi>blind,</hi> and tells us what they <hi>ſay to the blind man again.</hi> Why dos the <hi>Scripture</hi> call him <hi>blind</hi> after his ſight was reſtord? The reaſon is, not becauſe he was blind then, but becauſe he was blind before. Turn to the 7. ch. of <hi>S. Luke,</hi> and in the 22. v. you'l read theſe words of our <hi>Saviour, The blind ſee, the lame walk, the deaf hear:</hi> he ſays they <hi>ſee,</hi> and yet he calls them <hi>blind;</hi> he ſays they <hi>walk,</hi> &amp; yet he calls them <hi>lame;</hi> he ſays they <hi>hear,</hi> &amp; yet he calls them <hi>deaf.</hi> Why dos he call them <hi>blind, lame,</hi> &amp; <hi>deaf,</hi> when he himſelf bears witneſs that they <hi>ſee, walk,</hi> &amp; <hi>hear?</hi> The Anſwer lies before you: He calls them ſo, not becauſe they were ſo
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62850:25"/>then, but becauſe they were ſo before. In the 2. ch. of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial change of water into wine was much the ſame as <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> &amp; therefore the example is fitter for the purpoſe. In the 9 v. you read, that <hi>the Ruler of the Feaſt taſted the water that was made wine:</hi> You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but obſerve how plainly the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> ſays, it <hi>was made wine,</hi> and at the ſame time plainly calls it <hi>water.</hi> Will any man deny this miracle, and ſay it was not really &amp; truly wine, becauſe the <hi>Scripture</hi> calls it <hi>water</hi> after it <hi>was made wine?</hi> No, no; 'tis clear that, when the miracle was done, the <hi>Scripture</hi> calls it water, not becauſe it was water then, but becauſe it was water before. Read the 7. ch. of <hi>Exodus:</hi> you'l find in the 10. v. <hi>Aaron caſt down his rod before Pharaoh, &amp; it became a Serpent:</hi> in the 11. v. <hi>The Magicians of Egypt alſo did in like manner:</hi> &amp; in the 12. v. <hi>They caſt down every man his rod, but Aaron's rod ſwallowd up their rods.</hi> Pauſe here one moment. The <hi>Scripture</hi> plainly tells us that theſe rods were all chang'd into Serpents; and yet, after the change, the Scripture calls them rods; not
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62850:26"/>becauſe they were rods then, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were rods before. If any of our Adverſaries have a mind to ſay, theſe rods were not chang'd into Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> never chang'd water into wine, that when he told <hi>S. Iohn's</hi> diſciples <hi>the blind ſee, the lame walk, the deaf hear,</hi> he ſent them back to their maſter with ſo many lies in their mouths; if they have a mind to ſay, our <hi>Saviour</hi> never cur'd the man <hi>born blind;</hi> then they may have the ſame pretence to magnifie this trifling argument: But if they are the men which I would willingly believe they are, if they are candid &amp; ſincere, if they ſubmit their judgment fairly to the word of God, as it is plainly written in their own tranſlation of of the Bible; they cannot but inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly confeſs that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is not any way <hi>repugnant to plain words of holy Scripture;</hi> but that <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> it ſelf contutes the beſt of all their arguments which they produce againſt it.</p>
               <p>I will not ſay tis ignorance, but I am ſure 'tis either that, or want of ingenuity, which makes men argue that, becauſe there are ſome metaphors
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62850:26"/>in Scripture. Therefore the words of Conſecration are a Metaphor or Figure. No man denies but that we often meet with metaphors in <hi>Scripture;</hi> but then, either the common phraſe of ſpeaking evidently marks them out, or elſe they are explaind by what fore-runs or follows the expreſſion, &amp; ſo explaind that no judicious Reader doubts the meaning of them.</p>
               <p>When, in the 6. of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> our Saviour ſays, <hi>I am the bread of life;</hi> He adds, <hi>he that comes to me shall never hunger:</hi> When, in the 8. He ſays, <hi>I am the light of the world;</hi> He adds, <hi>he that follows me, shall have the light of life:</hi> When, in the 10. He ſays, <hi>I am the door;</hi> He adds, <hi>by me if any man enter, he shall be ſaved:</hi> When, in the 14. He ſays, <hi>I am the way;</hi> He adds, <hi>no man comes to my Father, but by me:</hi> When, in the 15. He ſays, <hi>I am the Vine;</hi> He adds, <hi>he that abides in me, brings forth much fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So when <hi>S. Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> 5. ch. 30. v. We <hi>are members of his body, of his flesh &amp; of his bones;</hi> He explicared it in the 23. v. that this <hi>Body,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Saviour</hi> of, is the <hi>Church;</hi> And when
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62850:27"/>he mentions <hi>flesh &amp; bones,</hi> he only carries on the metaphor by a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious alluſion to the 2. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> becauſe as <hi>Eve's</hi> Body drew its Being from the ſide of the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> when he ſlept in Paradiſe, ſo alſo the <hi>Church</hi> derives the grace, which animates it, from the ſide <hi>the flesh &amp; bones</hi> of the <hi>laſt Adam</hi> when he ſlept his mortal ſleep upon the Croſs. The verſe, which follows, leads directly to the place, and gives us, word for word, the 24. v. of the 2. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that we may evidently know the Senſe and Ground of the Compariſon.</p>
               <p>In the ſame manner, no leſs care is taken in the 1. to the <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. ch. &amp; 4. v. to explicate theſe words, <hi>That Rock was Chriſt. S. Paul</hi> ſeems to write with as much caution as if he had forſeen how much theſe words would be abuſed by thoſe who now compare them with the words of Conſecration. Leſt any man might think that, when he ſaid <hi>that rock was Chriſt,</hi> he took the word <hi>rock</hi> in the literal ſenſe, he plainly ſays, he ſpeaks of <hi>ſpiritual meat</hi> &amp; <hi>ſpiritual drink;</hi> he ſays in the ſame verſe, <hi>they drank of that ſpiritual rock which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62850:27"/>followd them, and that rock,</hi> (that is, <hi>that ſpiritual rock</hi>) <hi>was Chriſt.</hi> What could a man ſay more to acquaint the world with the true meaning of his words, &amp; give us an aſſurance that it is not literal, but only figurative &amp; metaphorical?</p>
               <p>Some people are willing to believe that, becauſe <hi>Chriſt's</hi> body &amp; blood are only metaphorically <hi>broken</hi> &amp; <hi>shed</hi> for us in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> therefore they are not really his body &amp; blood: As if, becauſe one word is figurative in a ſentence, therefore all the reſt muſt be ſo too, meerly for keeping it company; or as if we were oblig'd to believe that, becauſe <hi>Chriſt's ſitting at the right hand of his Father</hi> is a meer metaphor, therefore he did not really <hi>aſcend to Heaven.</hi> When in <hi>S. Luke,</hi> &amp; in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> we read theſe words, <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood;</hi> the <hi>Cup</hi> is one metaphor, the <hi>Teſtament</hi> is another, but hence it dos not follow that the <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is meerly metaphorical: For, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way of ſpeaking, when we ſay, <hi>This Glaſs is a new Health in Wine,</hi> the <hi>glaſs</hi> is one metaphor, the <hi>health</hi> is another, and yet the <hi>wine</hi> is truly
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62850:28"/>&amp; ſubſtantially Wine. Having thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the weakneſs of their arguments, by which they undertake to shew that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation is repugnant to plain words of holy Scripture;</hi> I shall now endeavour to make out, that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> may (if any thing can) be plainly <hi>provd by holy Writ:</hi> the proof of which shall make the ſecond part of my Diſcourſe.</p>

               <p>In the 6. ch. of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> promiſes that he will give us his flesh, that ſacred flesh which he deſign'd to ſacrifice upon the Croſs for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. In the 51. v. he ſays, <hi>the Bread that I will give is my Flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</hi> I know very well that in the former verſes, from 26. to 51. He uſes ſome expreſſions which are purely metaphorical: But, whatſoever a few modern Authors may ſay of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I can never be perſuaded, that this chapter talks of nothing elſe but <hi>Faith;</hi> &amp; that from 50. to 60. the <hi>Eating,</hi> which is ſo much talkt of, ſignifies nothing but <hi>Believing.</hi> We
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62850:28"/>have appeal'd to <hi>Scripture:</hi> Let it judge the Caſe betwixt us.</p>
               <p>When in the 52 v. we read how <hi>the Jews ſtrove amongſt themſelves, ſaying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?</hi> we know they underſtood him in the literal Senſe, &amp; wonderd how it could be true. If he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>only</hi> in a figurative Senſe; it had been eaſy to have told them ſo. In other matters, of much leſs impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, 'twas his uſual cuſtom to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound his meaning. <hi>Iohn,</hi> the 3. ch. &amp; 4. v. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>How can a man be born again when he is old?</hi> He let him underſtand He did not mean it in the literal ſenſe, but that He ſpoke of Baptiſm: <hi>Except a man be born of water &amp; the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Matth. 13. He propoſed to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples the <hi>Parable</hi> of the <hi>Sower:</hi> They underſtood it not: He preſently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it to them. The <hi>Parable</hi> of <hi>Tares</hi> they underſtood as little; but, as ſoon as they deſir'd him, He declar'd to them the whole myſtery of it. In theſe &amp; other occaſions, when he had ſpoken any thing obſcurely, He was always willing to interpret it: And
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62850:29"/>there was never more neceſſity than when the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſcandaliz'd to hear him ſay, <hi>the Bread that I will give is my Flesh.</hi> If he only deſign'd to give them <hi>Bread</hi> &amp; not his <hi>Flesh.</hi> I will not ſay He ought to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd himſelf, becauſe to punish their perverſneſs He might lawfully have left them in their ignorance; and, though he were the <hi>Light of the world,</hi> yet He might juſtly leave thoſe in the dark who obſlinately shut their eyes againſt him. But, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> should not only refuſe to explicate his words, but alſo make it his buſineſs to confirm them in an errour; that He, who came to inſtruct the world, should labour to deceive it; that He, who left the <hi>ninety nine sheep</hi> in the <hi>Deſert,</hi> should endeavour to drive the <hi>loſt sheep</hi> farther from the true way home; Let, who will, ſay it, A <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> muſt be asham'd to think it. If he were then reſolv'd to give us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to eat &amp; drink but <hi>bread</hi> &amp; <hi>wine,</hi> is it probable that He would ſo induſtriouſly repeat the eating of his <hi>Flesh</hi> &amp; drinking of his <hi>Blood?</hi> Is it poſſible that he should tell them in the 55. v. <hi>My Flesh is meat indeed,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62850:29"/>&amp; my Blood is drink indeed,</hi> if really the meat &amp; drink were neither <hi>Flesh</hi> nor <hi>Blood?</hi> When, in the 24. of <hi>S. Luke,</hi> our Adverſaries read, <hi>our Lord is riſen indeed;</hi> or, in the 4. of <hi>S. Iohn, this is indeed the Saviour of the world,</hi> They underſtand it &amp; believe it in the literal ſenſe: But, when they read theſe words, <hi>my Flesh is meat indeed, &amp; my Blood is drink indeed,</hi> they believe 'tis nothing elſe but ſacred <hi>bread</hi> &amp; <hi>wine.</hi> Is this <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi> Scripture? No, no; When <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> ſpeaks as plainly in one place as in another, &amp; no convincing reaſon can be given why they force the ſenſe of this place more than that, if they believe that &amp; not this, They do not believe the <hi>Scripture</hi> but themſelves; They do not believe becauſe they <hi>read</hi> it, but becauſe they <hi>like</hi> it.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Diſciples</hi> ſaw how ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly their <hi>Maſter</hi> taught the literal ſenſe, they cryd out, in the 60. v <hi>this is a hard ſaying, who can hear it?</hi> They conſider'd it <hi>foolishly</hi> (ſays <hi>S.

                  <hi>they underſtood it carnally, &amp; thought our Lord would chop of morſels of his flesh, &amp; give it them:</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:62850:30"/>They were not only ſtartled at the ſeeming impoſſibility, but alſo at the barbarouſneſs of the deſign: And the three following verſes shew us how our Saviour endeavour'd to let them know, it neither was impoſſible, nor barbarous. <hi>Dos this offend you?</hi> ſays He; Do you think I am not able to make good my words? Surely you know not who I am, you would not otherwiſe miſtruſt my Almighty Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. <hi>But what if you shall ſee the Son of man aſcend up where he was before?</hi> Then I ſuppoſe you'l know that I am God, and from that miracle conclude that this is eaſy to me, &amp; that I have not only wiſdom to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive but power to execute my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. <hi>Dos this offend you? It is the Spirit that quickneth, the flesh profiteth nothing: The words that I ſpeak unto you they are Spirit &amp; they are Life.</hi> I do not intend to give dead morſels of my flesh, which being ſeparated from my Spirit &amp; Divinity will profit nothing, becauſe they will not give your ſouls the liſe of grace. You shall not eat it in the natural form of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man flesh; that is indeed a carnal and a barbarous way of eating it: But
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62850:30"/>nevertheleſs, under the form of bread, you shall receive the true &amp; real <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of my flesh; and this is that <hi>ſpiritual</hi> way of eating which you are not yet acquainted with. This is the myſtery which I expect you should believe: This neither is impoſſible nor barbarous: This is not contrary to Reaſon, though it be above it. <hi>But</hi> yet, ſays he, v. 64. <hi>there are ſome of you that believe not:</hi> And, v. 65. he tells the reaſon why; becauſe, ſays he, <hi>no man can come unto me, unleſs it be given to him of my Father.</hi> Proud, Silly, Wretches, as we are? We think it is ſufficient to read Gods word; we think there goes no more than reading to believe it; we never reflect that no man can believe the word of God the <hi>Son,</hi> unleſs he firſt receive the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full grace of Chriſtian Humility from God the <hi>Father;</hi> that Grace by which we willingly ſubmit our Reaſon to ſuch myſteries as are above it.</p>
               <p>The 66. v. laies before our eyes the ſad example of thoſe <hi>many diſciples</hi> who <hi>from that time went back &amp; walkt no more with him.</hi> They heard the ſame words which our Adverſaries read; They heard the 63. v. which is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62850:31"/>ſo much magnified; They heard with great attention &amp; curioſity; &amp; if from thoſe expreſſions they had ſo clearly underſtood, that by his <hi>flesh</hi> he only meant a holy <hi>ſign</hi> or <hi>figure</hi> of it, they never would have damnd themſelves eternally by <hi>walking no more with him.</hi> They watchfully obſerv'd his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; his way of ſpeaking; and, as we better underſtand a friend when we diſcourſe with him than when we only read his Letters, ſo theſe diſciples ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the advantage of our Saviours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence &amp; familiar converſation could not but underſtand him much better than thoſe who only read in Scripture a ſmall part of thoſe diſcourſes with which He entertaind them. They plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood that, though he ſmooth'd the difficulty by telling them He did not ſpeak of carnal eating, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs he ſtill ſpoke poſitively, as to the literal Senſe: They had not that great grace of <hi>Chriſtian Humility,</hi> without which none can univerſally ſubmit their <hi>Reaſon</hi> to <hi>Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:</hi> They could not come to God the <hi>Son,</hi> becauſe they were not drawn by God the <hi>Father:</hi> Proud, as they were, away they went &amp; <hi>walkt no
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62850:31"/>more with Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> becauſe this myſtery was ſomething above their ſmall capacity; their weak imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions could not reach it.</p>
               <p>See here an ancient Model of the modern Reformation! They heard the <hi>Church</hi> teach as our <hi>Saviour</hi> taught, that the <hi>Sacramental</hi> Bread <hi>is Flesh indeed,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Sacramental</hi> Wine <hi>is Blood indeed,</hi> And ſo away they went with theſe words in their mouths, <hi>This is a hard ſaying; who can hear it?</hi> away they went, &amp; <hi>walkt with</hi> her <hi>no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>Saviour,</hi> who ſaw them thus abandon Him, and much more fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly reſented their eternal loſſe, than the contempt of his <hi>Voracity,</hi> did not ſo much as offer to call them back again, as certainly He would have done, had they been only guilty of miſtaking what he meant; but turn'd immediatly to his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and in the 67. v. ſaid to them, <hi>Will you alſo go away?</hi> Whereupon <hi>Simon Peter ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werd him; Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou haſt the words of eternal life; and we believe &amp; are ſure that Thou art Chriſt the Son of the living God:</hi> We believe, and are ſure that Thou
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62850:32"/>art able to make good thy words, although ſome people think them hard, &amp; cannot hear them.</p>
               <p>What our <hi>Saviour</hi> promis'd in the 6. of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> He performd at his laſt ſupper: And tis no wonder that he talkt of it ſo much before hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he dearly lov'd thoſe whom he died for, and always had his eye upon the <hi>Legacy</hi> which he deſign'd to leave them. The night before his death, in his laſt <hi>Will</hi> &amp; <hi>Teſtament,</hi> He left us this holy <hi>Sacrament</hi> as a perpetual monument of his Affection. We wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle &amp; diſpute about it, what <hi>This is?</hi> whether it <hi>is</hi> truly <hi>Bread,</hi> or truly the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> We agree that <hi>Holy Writ</hi> shall be the <hi>Iudge.</hi> We find, in Holy Writ, four Copies of our <hi>Saviour's Will</hi> &amp; <hi>Teſtament;</hi> in the 26. of <hi>S. Matthew,</hi> the 14. of <hi>S. Mark,</hi> the 22. of <hi>S. Luke,</hi> &amp; the 11. of the 1. to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> We open all of them; reſolving to ſtand or fall by their determination. In all the Copies of his <hi>Teſtament,</hi> the words are plain, <hi>This is my Body:</hi> And, as ſoon as the words are read, They preſently tell us; tis true, Our <hi>Saviour</hi> plainly ſays, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> but yet He only
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62850:32"/>means, <hi>it is a ſacred</hi> piece of <hi>bread,</hi> a <hi>holy figure</hi> of his body. For my part, I have ever admir'd, but never can ſufficiently admire, in this occaſion, the confidence of ſome men, that make ſuch noiſe with <hi>Scripture;</hi> and yet, as ſoon as ever the book is open, tell us the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſays one thing, &amp; means another, quite contrary to what it ſays.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, that nothing is more uſual than to give <hi>Signs</hi> the <hi>names</hi> of what they ſignifie: I eaſily confeſs, tis very true; when things are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known to be <hi>Signs:</hi> becauſe, <hi>Signs</hi> being only <hi>Subſtitutes,</hi> our thoughts never ſtop at them, but are preſently fixt upon the things they ſignifie; and, by the ſame reaſon that they put ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>thing</hi> in our <hi>minds,</hi> 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if they put another <hi>name</hi> in our <hi>mouths.</hi> Thus <hi>Joſeph</hi> plainly anſwerd <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> queſtion, when he ſaid,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Geneſ,</hi> 49.26.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſeven Kine are ſeven years.</hi> But when God inſtituted <hi>Circumciſion</hi> in the 17. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> He did not ſay, in the 10. verſe, This <hi>Circumciſion</hi> is my <hi>Covenant;</hi> but, in the 11. it <hi>shall be a token of my Covenant.</hi> So, in the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62850:33"/>12. of <hi>Exodus,</hi> when he inſtituted firſt the eating of the <hi>Paſchal Lamb,</hi> from the 5. v. to the 10. it plainly appears there was ſomething in it more than ordinary, and that it was not inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant; ſo that it is no wonder we find it written in the 11. v. <hi>It is the Paſſeover of the Lord:</hi> Moreover, the following verſes explicate the figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſenſe; the 26 v. puts the queſtion, <hi>what mean you by this ſervice?</hi> What dos it ſignifie? and the 27. gives the anſwer, <hi>it is the Sacrifice of the Lords Paſſeover,</hi> that is, it ſignifies the <hi>Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over.</hi> But, in our preſent caſe, 1. the <hi>Scripture</hi> dos not inſinuate before hand, that <hi>bread</hi> was an <hi>empty Sign</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's body;</hi> 2. there is nothing in <hi>Scripture</hi> that gives evidence for ſuch interpretation of our <hi>Saviour's</hi> words, as I have shewd in the firſt part of my Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>If any one object, that <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Flesh</hi> are oppoſite, &amp; therefore the ſenſe muſt of neceſſity be <hi>figurative:</hi> For a full anſwer to this difficulty I referr you to the 7. of <hi>S. Luke,</hi> where in the 22. v our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſays, <hi>the blind ſee, the lame walk, the deaf hear, the dead are rais'd.</hi> To be <hi>blind</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:62850:33"/>and ſee, to be <hi>lame</hi> and <hi>walk,</hi> to be <hi>deaf</hi> and <hi>hear,</hi> to be <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>alive,</hi> are things quite diſparate and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, &amp; yet our <hi>Saviour's</hi> words were evidently true in the plain <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe. From whence we may alſo inferr, that as theſe words <hi>the dead are rais'd</hi> cannot be literally true, unleſs the carkaſſe be <hi>ſubſtantially</hi> chang'd into a living man; ſo when our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſays <hi>This is my Body,</hi> theſe words can never be true in the plain <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe, unleſſe the <hi>Bread</hi> be by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle <hi>ſubſtantially</hi> chang'd into his <hi>Flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To prove the <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe, &amp; to convince us of it, what can we wish for more than the unan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mous conſent of all the four <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> and the ſubſcription of <hi>S. Paul?</hi> There is not one of them that writes, This is only a <hi>Sign</hi> of my body, a meer <hi>Figure</hi> of my flesh. Tis impoſſible the Senſe should every where be figurative in ſo many ſeveral places &amp; yet be no where explicated in the figurative ſenſe. In other things, of leſſe concern, we find that, what is metaphorically writ by one is explicated by another. <hi>S. Luke</hi> in his 11. ch. writes, <hi>if I in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62850:34"/>the finger of God caſt out Devils: S. Matthew</hi> in the 12. ch. explains it, <hi>if I caſt out Devils by the Spirit of God. S. Iohn,</hi> 6. ch. writes. <hi>Jeſus the Son of Joſeph, S. Luke</hi> 3. ch. explains it, <hi>Jeſus being, as was ſuppoſed, the Son of Joſeph.</hi> Our <hi>Saviour</hi> frequently invites the <hi>thirſty</hi> to him, &amp; promiſes them <hi>living water: S. Iohn</hi> in the 7. ch. explains it, <hi>He ſpoke this of the ſpirit which they, who believd on him, should receive.</hi> But theſe words, which we read in all of them, are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd by any one of them. From whence 'tis eaſy to inferr, that all theſe ſacred Pen-men never underſtood our Adverſaries figurative ſenſe: They literally <hi>underſtood</hi> it, as we do; <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievd</hi> it as they underſtood it; &amp; <hi>writ</hi> as they believ'd it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Mark</hi> 4. ch. 34. v. ſays of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> that <hi>when they were alone He expounded all things to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi> If then our <hi>Saviour</hi> us'd a <hi>Figure,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> 'tis certain that <hi>when they were alone</hi> (at leaſt) <hi>he expounded</hi> this figure to them. Perhaps the four <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> &amp; the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> knew well enough this expoſition, but forgot to write it. This
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62850:34"/>will not ſerve the turn. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> promis'd them their memory should ever be aſſiſted by his holy <hi>Spirit:</hi> In the 14. ch. of <hi>S. Iohn;</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <hi>the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>shall bring all things into your remembrance whatſoever I have ſaid unto you.</hi> Perhaps they every one thought of it when they writ, but did not think it worth the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. But if our Adverſaries well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the <hi>ſixth Article</hi> of <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which tells us <hi>all things neceſſary to Salvation are contain'd in Scripture,</hi> they will ſcarce find room for this reply: becauſe this expoſition would have been ſo neceſſary to prevent the <hi>Idolatry</hi> which they accuſe us of, &amp; conſequently neceſſary to <hi>Salvation.</hi> Since therefore this Interpretation ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could have been <hi>forgot,</hi> if ever they had known it; Since it could not be <hi>omitted</hi> if they had remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd it; it follows clearly that this explication was never known amongſt them, but only is a new invention of the modern <hi>Reformation,</hi> directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to <hi>Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot but admire when I reflect, how thick a miſt mens paſſions and

               <head>FIRST PART.</head>
               <p>* Before I enter upon our proofs of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> it will be worth obſerving, how almoſt all our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries are miſtaken, upon a groundleſs ſuppoſition, that if they can find ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in the <hi>Fathers</hi> which import that the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is a <hi>type</hi> a <hi>ſign</hi> a <hi>figure,</hi> They need not ſeek any farther; The queſtion is already decided; The <hi>Fathers</hi> never believ'd the myſtery of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> Now, I muſt needs conleſs, if we denied the <hi>Sacrament</hi> to be a <hi>type</hi> a <hi>ſign</hi> or <hi>figure,</hi> we ought to ſtand corrected: Or, if all this were inconſiſtent with the myſtery of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,</hi> we ought to own our <hi>Fathers</hi> Belief was contrary to ours. But if in both theſe points our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries are miſtaken, we muſt beg their pardon if we ſtill perſever in our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* If they would only conſider the difference betwixt the <hi>inward ſubſtance</hi> &amp; the <hi>outward form,</hi> betwixt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide &amp; the outſide, of the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> They would eaſily reconcile the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent expreſſions which they meet with
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62850:37"/>in the <hi>Fathers</hi> writings. When the <hi>Fathens</hi> were intent upon the <hi>outward form,</hi> They call it a <hi>type,</hi> a <hi>ſign,</hi> a <hi>figure;</hi> They ſay <hi>it is not</hi> his <hi>Body</hi> &amp; <hi>Blood,</hi> but that it <hi>ſignifies</hi> it, <hi>repreſents</hi> it, &amp; <hi>contains</hi> it.</p>
               <p>* <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> in his 23. epiſtle to <hi>Bonifacius,</hi> ſays, <hi>the Sacrament of the Body of Chriſt is in ſome manner Chriſt's Body, .... as the Sacrament of Faith is Faith.</hi> The parity is good betwixt the <hi>outward form</hi> of bread, and <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> in this reſpect, that <hi>both</hi> are <hi>ſigns:</hi> Only this difference there is, the firſt contains what it ſignifies, the other dos not. So in his book againſt <hi>Adimantus,</hi> 12. ch. he ſays. <hi>Our Lord did not doubt to ſay, This is my Body, when He gave them a ſign of his Body.</hi> And why should he doubt? If a man give his friend a purſe of money, He dos not doubt to ſay, <hi>This is my Money,</hi> although the Purſe be only a <hi>ſign</hi> of it. If a purſe be empty, tis an empty <hi>ſign:</hi> But if it be full, it then contains all that it ſignifies, and what it repreſents is truly &amp; ſubſtantially preſent. <hi>Bread</hi> in the Old Law was an empty ſign of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Body: The outward form of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62850:38"/>Bread is ſtill a ſign of it; but not an empty ſign, becauſe it really contains the ſelfſame Body which it repreſents. I take no notice of <hi>S. Auſtin's</hi> words in the 3. book of his <hi>Chriſtian Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,</hi> where he ſaies, Our Saviour<note n="*" place="bottom">ch. <hi>16.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>ſeems to command a heinous wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ... therefore 'tis a figure:</hi> I take no notice of it, becauſe He dos not ſay it is an <hi>empty</hi> figure. He only ſays, our Saviours ſpeech is <hi>figurative</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe of the <hi>Capernaites,</hi> that barbarous ſenſe in which, indeed, it is a <hi>heinous</hi> crime to eat our <hi>Saviour's</hi> flesh.</p>
               <p>* I alſo paſs over <hi>Tertullian's</hi> words, in his 4. book againſt <hi>Marcion;</hi>

                  <hi>This is my Body, that is, This figure of my Body:</hi> I paſs them over becauſe the true ſenſe amounts to no more, than that <hi>This</hi> bread, which in the Old Law was but a <hi>figure of my Body,</hi> now in the New Law <hi>is my Body.</hi> The obſcurity of this great man is well enough known to all that are acquainted with him: Nor can any, who converſe with him, be ignorant that the figure <hi>Hyperbaton</hi> is often in his mouth. In the ſame book, ch. 11.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62850:38"/>he ſays, <hi>To a Parable will I open my mouth, that is, Similitude:</hi> and (in his book againſt <hi>Praxeas</hi>) <hi>Chriſt is dead, that is, Anointed</hi> This is enough to shew the affected tranſpoſition of his words: And, for the ſenſe, it may be eaſily conjectur'd by the deſign of his book; the principal end of which, is to shew the correſpondency betwixt the <hi>Old</hi> Law and the <hi>New;</hi> to which purpoſe it was a very pertinent obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that the Form of Bread, in the <hi>Old</hi> Law was an <hi>empty</hi> figure of what is <hi>fullfill'd</hi> in the <hi>New.</hi> In the ſame ſenſe <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſays in his 1. book againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> that<note n="*" place="bottom">ch. <hi>14.</hi>

               <p>* Some people have ſuch little ſouls, they cannot raiſe their thoughts above their vulgar notions; they are not much acquainted with thoſe <hi>ſigns</hi> which ſignifie things preſent; thoſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62850:40"/>
                  <hi>ſigns</hi> which are not appointed to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the defect of <hi>real preſence,</hi> but only to ſupply the want of <hi>viſible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance:</hi> And therefore they will not allow that there are any ſuch <hi>ſigns</hi> in the World. Say what you will, they mind not what you ſay, but tell you over &amp; over again, that, if the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>form</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> be a <hi>ſign</hi> of his Body, 'tis certain his Body is not really and truly preſent. Have but a little patience; and I shall quickly clear this point. My <hi>Speech</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> are <hi>ſigns</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> &amp; <hi>Soul</hi> in me: And muſt I believe a Sophiſter, if any were ſo ſilly as to tell me, <hi>Therefore</hi> I am a <hi>dead</hi> man, becauſe it is the nature of all <hi>ſigns</hi> to <hi>exclude</hi> the <hi>real preſence</hi> of what they ſignifie? The form of a Serpent in <hi>Paradiſe</hi> was in ſome manner a <hi>ſign</hi> of the Evil Spirit that tempted <hi>Eve;</hi> and was not this <hi>Evil Spirit</hi> really &amp; truly preſent? The form of a Dove appearing at our <hi>Saviour's</hi> Baptiſm; &amp; the forms of fiery tongues appearing on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> repreſented the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> And will you ſay the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> was never really preſent, neither one time nor other? The human forms which,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62850:40"/>in the old <hi>Teſtament,</hi> the Angels uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſumed, repreſented the <hi>Angels;</hi> And were thoſe <hi>Angels</hi> never truly &amp; ſubſtantially preſent? Such inſtances as theſe, I may preſume, our Adverſaries do not well conſider: if they did, they never would conclude that the <hi>Fathers</hi> denied the myſtery of <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> becauſe they call the <hi>outward form</hi> a <hi>type,</hi> a <hi>ſign,</hi> or <hi>figure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* Beſides this mighty difficulty, which I now have clearly ſatisfied, There remains one more; which is, that according to the Doctrine of the Fathers, the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of bread remains after Conſecration. Here, I muſt needs confeſs, they charge us home: And, if they can perform what they promiſe, we are always ready to come over to them. But having been, ſo long, in full &amp; peaceable poſſeſſion of a Truth deliver'd to us as an ancient article of Faith, they cannot reaſonably expect that we should quit our hold, before they bring clear evidence againſt our Title to it. Neceſſity obliges them to make this bold attempt. They know, if once they grant that all the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Antiquity runs clear and ſtrong againſt them, they never can be able
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62850:41"/>to bear up againſt the ſtream. They are ſenſible how plainly the <hi>Fathers</hi> ſpeak their mind in favour of this myſtery; And therefore ſearch amongſt the darkeſt paſſages of all their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, where they are glad to meet with any thing that makes a plauſible appearance.</p>
               <p>* The Sum of their Objection is this; that <hi>S. Chryſoſtom, Theodoret,</hi> and <hi>Gelaſius</hi> expreſſly affirm, that the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of bread <hi>remains</hi> after Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration; and therefore it is not chang'd into the body of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* This, at firſt ſight, ſeems plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough, nor is it any wonder if it ſtartle thoſe who never heard of it before. And yet, if all theſe great Men, by their <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> meant no more than the true nature of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward forms &amp; ſenſible qualities; there is no danger of their disbelieving <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> We believe the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> is really chang'd; and theſe <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> were pleas'd to ſay, the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> is really the ſame: but yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after all the noiſe they make with it, the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> and we may agree ſo far as to be both in the right, if we take the ſame word in different ſenſes; &amp; they
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62850:41"/>by <hi>ſubſtance</hi> mean one thing, whilſt we mean another. <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> both old &amp; new, diſtinguishes betwixt the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſubſtance</hi> &amp; the <hi>outward forms</hi> of all corporeal Beings. Theſe are the uſual and familiar object of our <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> that's an entity ſo ſubtil &amp; ſo metaphyſical that nothing but our <hi>Underſtanding</hi> can diſcern it. Tis not, indeed, a <hi>Spirit;</hi> but it is no more to be diſcover'd by our Senſes, than a human <hi>Soul</hi> is in a <hi>Body.</hi> Extenſion, figure, colour, and its other qualities, are the Apparel which it wears; and theſe affect our <hi>Senſes;</hi> But the naked <hi>Subſtance</hi> of all Bodies is perpetually hidden from <hi>them.</hi> However, although <hi>Philoſophers</hi> make this diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the inward ſubſtance &amp; the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward forms, nevertheleſs the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Mankind look no farther than their Senſes lead them: They judge of bodies by their qualities &amp; natural effects: By theſe they <hi>ſenſibly</hi> diſcern one <hi>Subſtance</hi> from another: And this is all they think of, when they talk of <hi>Subſtance.</hi> When any of the <hi>Fathers</hi> ſay, the <hi>Subſtance</hi> or <hi>nature</hi> of bread &amp; wine remains after conſecration, they onely condeſcend ſo far as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodate
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62850:42"/>their way of ſpeaking to the vulgar phraſe: And truly, what they mean, we all believe: We doubt not but all, which is vulgarly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> is the ſame: We doubt not but our Senſes tell us truth; and that all the outward forms &amp; qualities of bread &amp; wine remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alter'd: The <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> declares there is no change in theſe;<note n="*" place="bottom">Seſſ. <hi>13.</hi> can. <hi>2.</hi>

                  <hi>manen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus ſpeciebus panis &amp; vini.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Fathers</hi> uſe ſometimes this vulgar notion of <hi>Subſtance,</hi> what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is it if ſometimes they tell us, that the <hi>nature</hi> or the <hi>Subſtance</hi> is the ſame? What wonder is it, if <hi>S. Chryſoſtom</hi> in his epiſtle to <hi>Ceſarius,</hi> write thus? <hi>As before Conſecration we call it Bread, but after it is no longer call'd Bread but the Body of our Lord, although the Nature of Bread remains in it; and it dos not become two Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies but one Body of Chriſt: So here the Divine Nature being joyn'd to the Human, they both make one Son, &amp; one Perſon.</hi> By the <hi>Nature</hi> of a Body we uſually aprehend no more than the exteriour qualities which we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover by our <hi>Senſes;</hi> And when we
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62850:42"/>find a change in theſe, we uſually ſay the <hi>Nature</hi> changes, although the <hi>Body</hi> ſtill remain the ſame. And, by the ſame rule, when the accidents make ſtill the ſame impreſſion upon our Senſes, although the Body by a miracle be chang'd, we ſay the <hi>Nature</hi> is the ſame. Beſides, Theſe very words, which are produc'd againſt us, shew clearly that <hi>S Chryſoſtom</hi> diſtinguishes betwixt the <hi>Nature</hi> of bread, &amp; the <hi>Body</hi> of bread. Dos not he ſay that although the <hi>Nature</hi> or accidents of Bread remain, yet the <hi>Body</hi> or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of bread dos not remain; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there remains but <hi>One Body;</hi> and this <hi>one Body,</hi> if we believe him, is not the <hi>Body</hi> of bread, but the <hi>Body of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* With as little reaſon they triumph becauſe <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſays in his 2. Dialo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue; <hi>The myſtical Symboles remain in their former Subſtance form &amp; figure, &amp; may be ſeen &amp; toucht as before:</hi> And <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> in his book <hi>De duabus in Chriſto naturis,</hi> ſays, <hi>the Subſtance or Nature of bread &amp; wine dos not ceaſe.... they remain in the propriety of their Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* <hi>Theodoret</hi> dos not ſpeak of the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62850:43"/>
                  <hi>corporeal Subſtance</hi> of bread by which it differs from a <hi>Spirit;</hi> but expreſsly names the <hi>myſtical Symboles</hi> which are the <hi>outward forms</hi> &amp; <hi>accidents</hi> of bread &amp; wine: And <hi>Gelaſius</hi> urging the ſame argument againſt the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychians,</hi> uſes the word <hi>Subſtance</hi> only once, and the word <hi>Nature</hi> twice, to let us ſee that by the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the <hi>myſtical Symboles,</hi> or (as he calls them) <hi>the Sacraments which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> he only means the <hi>nature</hi> or the <hi>eſſence</hi> of the <hi>ſenſible Accidents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* And now I deſire to know what wonder there is in all this? Is it any unheard of News to Men of Letters, that ſuch words as <hi>ſubſtance, nature, eſſence,</hi> are promiſcuouſly made uſe of, even by <hi>Philoſophers?</hi> and that, by them, they mean to ſignifie the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any other <hi>predicament,</hi> or any <hi>real being,</hi> as well as that of <hi>ſubſtance? S. Auſtin</hi> was undoubtedly a great <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> &amp; yet He calls every <hi>real Being</hi> by the name of <hi>Subſtance.</hi> In his <hi>Enarration</hi> upon the 68. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> he ſays. <hi>Quod nulla ſubſtantia eſt, nihil omnino eſt: That which has no ſubſtance is nothing at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* If this be true (you'l ſay) their
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62850:43"/>argument againſt the <hi>Eutychians</hi> will be good for nothing. Excuſe me. The <hi>Eutychians</hi> held that there was onely <hi>One Nature</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe they were pleas'd to fancy that his human nature was abſorpt in the Divinity &amp; chang'd into it. To prove the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial change of human nature into the Divinity, they argued from the miraculous change of bread into the body of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> which argument they never would have urged, if they had not known that the Catholicks of that Age believ'd the myſtery of <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation. Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Gelaſius</hi> anſwer, that the <hi>outward forms</hi> of bread &amp; wine remain the ſame as formerly; from whence it follows evidently that, not only the <hi>accidents</hi> of <hi>human nature</hi> but alſo, the very <hi>ſubſiance</hi> of it, ſtill remains in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Becauſe the <hi>accidents</hi> of <hi>human nature,</hi> ſeparated from the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of it, are neither capable of <hi>hypoſtatick union</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> nor of exerciſing the <hi>vital operations</hi> of a <hi>Man.</hi> But mang learned men who read <hi>Gelaſius</hi> and <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,</hi> want either skill or patience to underſtand them. They find theſe words, <hi>the ſubſtance of bread remains,</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:62850:44"/>and are ſo much tranſported with the joyfull news of any thing that looks but like an argument againſt the <hi>Old Religion</hi> they have undertaken to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form;</hi> they do not well conſider what the word may ſignifie, but willingly ſuppoſe the Senſe is juſt the ſame as they would have it; ſet their hearts at reſt; and look no farther.</p>
               <p>* I have now ſufficiently examin'd what the <hi>Fathers</hi> ſay concerning the <hi>outward form</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> what they mean by calling it a <hi>type,</hi> a <hi>ſign,</hi> or <hi>figure;</hi> &amp; what they underſtand when they call it the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> or <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of bread. I now come cloſe to the main point of the <hi>Queſtion:</hi> What they have taught &amp; conſtantly believ'd, during the firſt eight <hi>Centuries,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>inward ſubſtance</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> Whether they believ'd it was the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of <hi>bread</hi> &amp; <hi>wine,</hi> or the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's body</hi> &amp; <hi>blood?</hi>

               <p>Our Adverſaries take a great deal of pains to perſuade us, that <hi>Paſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> was the firſt broacher of this Doctrine; from him they date the firſt Riſe of it, about the beginning of the IX.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral learned Men have taken pains to excuſe him, &amp; to shew that all theſe inſtances were only intended to prove the difference betwixt the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form &amp; inward ſubſtance of the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> If this were all; I confeſs he might mean well; but He has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſst himſelf ſo very ill, that (for my part) I do not think him worth quarreling for.

               <p>Let us now conſider the VIII. Age; And we shall ſee the ſtream of Truth run clearer, as we approach nigher the Fountain. <hi>S. John Damaſcen</hi> in his <hi>Orthodox Faith,</hi> 3. Book &amp; 14. chapter, diſcourſes thus: <hi>The Body tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyn'd to the Divinity is that which was born of the Virgin; not that the Body, He aſſum'd, deſcends from heaven; but the bread it ſelf &amp; wine are chang'd into the Body &amp; Blood of God: which, if you ask, How it can be done? Tis enough for you to hear, it is done by the Holy Ghoſt .... No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> ſays he, <hi>is more clear and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, than that God's word is true and efficacious and omnipotent ..... After a wonderfull manner they are chang'd into the Body and Blood of Chriſt, and are not two, but one &amp; the ſame ... Neither are the Bread &amp; Wine a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Chriſt's Body &amp; Blood, but the Body it ſelf of our Lord, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with his Divinity: For our Lord himſelf ſaid; This is, not a ſign of my
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62850:48"/>Body, but my Body; nor a ſign of my Blood, but my Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto ye have heard <hi>S. Iohn Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcen;</hi> Pray, what do ye think of him? Do ye think that No body in the VIII. Age believ'd the myſtery of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation?</hi> Well: but He was only one man. What ſay ye then, if I produce 350. more? I mean the 350. Bishops who ſate in the VII. general <hi>Council,</hi> call'd in the 87. year of the VIII. Age.</p>
               <p>* The <hi>Iconoclaſt</hi> Hereticks would not allow any <hi>relative</hi> worship; and therefore refus'd all worship of any images but the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> All other images of Chriſts Humanity, ſubſisting by themſelves, were (as they fancied) falſe images, and favour'd the Hereſie of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> who gave his Humanity a proper ſubſiſtence by it ſelf: But the outward form of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> not being a thing ſubſiſtent by it ſelf, but ſupported by the inviſible ſubſtance &amp; Perſon of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was a true image and might not only be retain'd but ador'd. So clear it is, that the <hi>Iconoclaſts</hi> did not deny <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation;</hi> but, becauſe they believ'd it, therefore they allow'd the adoration
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62850:49"/>of the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> They ſay, indeed, the Sacramental bread muſt <hi>not be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur'd in the shape of a human body, for fear of introducing Idolatry;</hi> but they only fear'd the introducing of other Image-worship, given to other pictures of our <hi>Saviour</hi> which do not really contain <hi>Him.</hi> However, they did not ſpeak their mind ſo plain, but that the <hi>Council</hi> doubted of their meaning: &amp;, ſuppoſing that by the word <hi>image</hi> they underſtood an <hi>empty ſign,</hi> the Bishops quarreld with the ſeeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of their terms, calling the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> ſometimes <hi>an Image, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times his Body:</hi> And argued againſt them that <hi>if it be an</hi> empty <hi>image, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be this Divine Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Read the VI. <hi>Action,</hi> and you will find the Judgment of the whole <hi>Council</hi> deliverd plainly in theſe words: <hi>None of the Trompets of the Holy Ghoſt, the holy Apoſtles and our illuſtrious Fathers, did ever call our unbloody Sacrifice... an image of his Body. Neither did they learn of our Lord, ſo to ſay &amp; confeſs ... He did not ſay, Take &amp; eat the image of my Body.... The bread &amp; wine, before they are ſanctified, are call'd Types;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62850:49"/>but after their ſanctification they are properly call'd the Body &amp; Blood of Chriſt: They are ſo, &amp; are believ'd to be ſo.</hi> Theſe are the words of 350. Bishops, who all with one voice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, They firmly believe that, what was bread before, is after conſecration properly <hi>Chriſt's</hi> body, &amp; not only an image of it: And this is all we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So much for the VIII. Age. I come now to the 3. next Ages, the V. the VI. and VII. And becauſe the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Party is willing to believe <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> favours them, we will begin with <hi>S. Auſtin.</hi> I am not ignorant that in his Writings upon the <hi>Ghoſpel</hi> of <hi>S.John.</hi> he copiouſly dilates upon the figurative ſenſe; and that in his 3. book <hi>De Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinâ Chriſtianâ,</hi> he ſays that the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> is a figure of our Lord's Paſſion, which when we receive, we ought <hi>to lay up in our memory, that his flesh was crucified and wounded for us.</hi> But on the other ſide, I know, that as when <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> ſays, in his 9. Tract upon <hi>S. John,</hi> that the converſion of water into wine was a figure of the ſpiritual converſion of the Law into the Ghoſpel, He dos not deny the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62850:50"/>change of water into wine; ſo when he ſays, the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is a figure of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Paſſion, He dos not deny <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> In the 9. ch. of his 2. book, <hi>Contra Adv. Legis &amp; Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum,</hi> he ſays, that <hi>with faithfull hearts &amp; mouths we receive the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of God &amp; men Chriſt Jeſus, giving us his flesh to eat, &amp; his Blood to drink; although it ſeems more horrible, to eat man's flesh, than to kill it, or to drink man's blood, than to shed it.</hi> In this place, he firſt diſtinguishes two ways of eating; oral, and ſpiritua; &amp; then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts them both. And I could wish they would take a little notice of this place, who ſo much pleaſe themſelves with popular declamations againſt the pretended barbarouſneſs of this <hi>Myſtery.</hi> In his <hi>Comments</hi> upon the 33. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> He makes no difficulty of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting all the real conſequences of this myſtery, which to our Adverſaries ſeem abſurd &amp; impoſſible; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; that <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Body should be at the ſame time in two places, that he should hold himſelf in his own hand, give himſelf to his Diſciples, keep himſelf to himſelf, &amp; the like. Firſt he moves the difficulty: <hi>Who is carried in his own
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62850:50"/>hands? In another's hands one may be carried; No man is carried in his own.</hi> Afterwards he anſwers; <hi>Chriſt was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in his own hands; when commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> to them <hi>his own Body, He ſaid, This is my Body; For he carried that Body in his own hands.</hi> I will only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one more teſtimony of this <hi>Father;</hi> but ſo plain a one, that 'tis impoſſible any man in his wits should have utter'd if he had not believ'd the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> In his <hi>Comments</hi> upon the 98. <hi>Pſalm; Chriſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>took flesh of the flesh of Mary; in this flesh he walkt here with us; this flesh he gave us to eat, that we may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: No body eats this flesh, but firſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dores it.</hi> Obſerve his words: He plainly ſpeaks of <hi>oral</hi> eating; he dos not mean only <hi>believing:</hi> if he did, he would not ſay, we always <hi>adore</hi> before we <hi>eat;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis evident, we do not <hi>adore</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we <hi>believe.</hi> Pray, what is this we adore before we eat? is it only apiece of bread, a wafer, a ſacred figure of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> body? Surely you will not make <hi>S. Auſtin,</hi> &amp; all the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of his time. Idolaters? Adore a thing which they believ'd was not their God? No, no: They believ'd that although before
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62850:51"/>the words of Conſecration it was only a piece of bread, yet after Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration it was by God's Omnipotence ſubſtantially
chang'd into the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; ſo became their <hi>God</hi> as well as their <hi>Food;</hi> And therefore the Chriſtians of that Age ador'd the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> before they durſt approach to eat it; &amp; <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> was ſo zealous for this <hi>Adoration,</hi> that he ſays in the ſame place, <hi>It is not only lawfull to adore, but a Sin not to adore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Diſpute that was betwixt <hi>Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> &amp; <hi>S Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> plainly shews that in thoſe times this myſtery was univerſally believ'd. <hi>Neſtorius</hi> fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied there were two perſons in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the one true <hi>God,</hi> the other true <hi>Man,</hi> and pretended to prove that the <hi>Flesh</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Divinity</hi> are not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one Perſon. The <hi>Scripture</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told him that we eat the <hi>Flesh</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> But, ſaid he, We do not eat the <hi>Divinity;</hi> Therefore the <hi>Fleſh</hi> &amp; the <hi>Divinity</hi> are not united in one Perſon. If <hi>S. Cyril</hi> had believ'd that what we <hi>eat</hi> with our mouths is meer bread, He might eaſily have anſwerd; That this argument only proves, the nature of <hi>bread</hi> &amp; the Divine nature are not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62850:51"/>in one Perſon. But, becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd that the <hi>Sacrament</hi> which ſeems meer bread, is not any longer <hi>bread,</hi> but the true <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's Body;</hi> therefore he anſwerd that <hi>although we do not eat the Divine Nature, yet the holy Flesh of Chriſt is not common Flesh .... 'tis the proper Body of the Word, which gives life to all things.</hi> This <hi>Argument</hi> and <hi>Anſwer</hi> you may read in his <hi>Apology</hi> for his <hi>Anathema's.</hi> The <hi>Catholiks</hi> &amp; the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> both agreed in the common belief, that the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is not <hi>bread,</hi> but the <hi>Flesh</hi> of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Otherwiſe <hi>Neſtorius</hi> had been the moſt ſilly Diſputant that ever liv'd, &amp; <hi>S. Cyril</hi> had been quite infatuated that did not give another Anſwer. <hi>Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> argued: We do not <hi>eat</hi> the <hi>Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> Therefore the <hi>Flesh</hi> is not united to the <hi>Divine Perſon. S. Cyril</hi> anſwerd: The <hi>Flesh,</hi> which we eat, <hi>gives life;</hi> therefore 'tis united to the <hi>Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> without which it <hi>profiteth nothing,</hi> according to our <hi>Saviour's</hi> words in the ſixth chapter of <hi>S.

                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:62850:52"/>there are two natures, to wit, the viſible nature of the outward forms, and the inviſible nature of <hi>Chriſt's ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:</hi> And explicating how this is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, he ſays; <hi>The Bread &amp; Wine are chang'd, by the Operation of the Holy Ghoſt, into the Divine ſubſtance.</hi> The Accidents of bread &amp; wine <hi>remain</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Gelaſius, in the propriety of their Nature;</hi> but yet <hi>the bread &amp; wine are chang'd into the Divine Subſtance.</hi> Think a little of this; and tell me, what it is, if it be not <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>

                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:62850:52"/>he ſays, the Sacramental bread <hi>is chang'd;</hi> In the ſecond, he ſays, <hi>it is ador'd.</hi> What <hi>change</hi> is this which makes the Sacramental bread deſerve to be <hi>ador'd?</hi> Conſider it a while, and you will find it nothing elſe but <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation.</hi>

               <p>I should be tedious, if I undertook to lay before you all the Teſtimonies of the Fathers who, in theſe three A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, have writ upon this ſubject. Theſe which I have produc'd already, are beyond exception: They declare the <hi>Faith</hi> of the Ages they liv'd in; They ſay the <hi>Sacramental</hi> bread is chang'd into the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> They ſay, No body eats it, but firſt adores it; They ſay it is a Sin not to adore it: All this They ſay, &amp; this is all we underſtand by <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>

               <p>I come now to the firſt four <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies,</hi> and put the Queſtion to thoſe <hi>Fathers</hi> who had the happyneſs to flourish in the beſt &amp; pureſt times of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> Whether the <hi>inward Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> be <hi>bread</hi> &amp; <hi>wine,</hi> or whether it be the <hi>Body</hi> &amp; <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt?

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62850:53"/>follows evidently that it is no longer <hi>Bread:</hi> And, whether it be true, or no, is the Queſtion which the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the firſt four Ages are to anſwer.</p>

                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:62850:54"/>of <hi>Poictiers</hi> tells you, in his 8. book <hi>De Trinitate,</hi> where taking notice of our <hi>Saviour's</hi> words in the 6. ch. of <hi>S. John,</hi> He ſays, <hi>There is no place leſt for doubting of the Truth of his Body &amp; Blood; for now, by our Lord's Profeſſion, &amp; our Faith, 'tis truly his Body, &amp; truly his Blood.</hi> Hear <hi>S. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> in his <hi>Ancorat;</hi> where, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Allegorical Senſe of <hi>Origen</hi> in the Creation of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges ſeveral places out of <hi>Scripture;</hi> which, though they are hard to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, are univerſally believ'd in the plain literal ſenſe. Amongſt the reſt he produces the example of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> &amp; thus diſcourſes upon it: <hi>We ſee it is not equal, nor like</hi> the Body of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> &amp; yet our <hi>Saviour would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, This is my Body; Nor is there any one who dos not believe theſe words of his: For he, who dos not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them to be true, falls abſolutely from the ſtate of Grace &amp; of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> What think ye of this? Do ye think theſe great Men did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the faith of the Age they lived in? Do ye think they were not able to inform the World, concerning the <hi>Faith</hi> of former Ages, much better
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62850:54"/>than our late Reformers, who came into the World above a thouſand years after them? They tell us, The literal Senſe is matter of <hi>Faith;</hi> &amp; that they who do not believe it are neither in the <hi>State of Grace, nor of Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, that any <hi>Real Preſence</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Body, or the <hi>Impanation</hi> of his <hi>Perſon,</hi> is enough: What need is there of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> to verifie the <hi>literal Senſe?</hi> The Anſwer is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious &amp; clear. 1. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> did not ſay, My Body <hi>is here,</hi> but <hi>This is</hi> my Body: And although any <hi>real preſence</hi> is enough to make good the <hi>former</hi> Aſſertion, yet nothing leſs than a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial change</hi> can verifie the <hi>later.</hi> 2. Although by virtue of an <hi>hypoſtatick</hi> union, it may be as true to ſay, <hi>This bread is Chriſt,</hi> as to ſay, <hi>This Man is God;</hi> yet ſtill 'twill be as falſe to ſay, <hi>This Bread is the Body of Chriſt,</hi> as to ſay, <hi>This Humanity is the Divinity.</hi> Beſides, it falls out a little unluckily that this Invention, only ſerves to pull down the old <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> &amp; to ſet up a new one; by changing the <hi>ſubſiſtence</hi> of bread, into the divine <hi>Subſiſtence,</hi> the <hi>Second Perſon</hi> of the <hi>B. Trinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:62850:55"/>
               <p>It cannot be litterally verified that <hi>This Bread</hi> (or <hi>This thing</hi> which was bread) <hi>is the Flesh of Chriſt;</hi> unleſs the bread be chang'd into his flesh; that is, ceaſe to be bread, and begin to be his flesh: And this is the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial change which we call <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</hi> There are two ſorts of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: one <hi>accidental,</hi> as when cold water is made warm; another <hi>ſubſtantial,</hi> as when our <hi>Saviour</hi> chang'd water into wine. An accidental change may warm the water; but only a ſubſtantial change can make it wine. In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, an accidental change may make <hi>bread</hi> a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but nothing leſs than a ſubſtantial change can make it the <hi>Flesh</hi> or <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* The <hi>Fathers</hi> often compare theſe changes, but never confound the one with the other. <hi>S. Cyril</hi> of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> in his 1. <hi>Myſtagogick Catechiſe,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves that, <hi>as Bread, by invocation of the Trinity, is made the Body of Chriſt;</hi> ſo meats offer'd to Devils are <hi>made impure</hi> by invocation of them. In his 3. <hi>Catechiſe,</hi> he ſays; <hi>As bread, after the invocation, is the Body of Chriſt,</hi> ſo the Oyntment after conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration <hi>is the Chriſme of Chriſt. S.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62850:55"/>Ambroſe</hi> in his 4. book <hi>De Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> ch. 4. proves that <hi>Chriſt</hi> can effect great changes above nature, becauſe by his grace <hi>We are new Creatures in Him.</hi> But yet the <hi>Fathers</hi> do not ſay, Theſe changes are equal to That by which Bread is made the Body of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Theſe Aſſertions, <hi>This meat is impure, This oyntment is the Chriſm of Chriſt, This man is a new creature in Chriſt;</hi> All This is evidently veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the plain literal Senſe by a meer <hi>accidental change:</hi> But when the Fathers ſay, <hi>This bread is the Flesh of Chriſt,</hi> Nothing but a <hi>ſubſtantial change</hi> can verifie the plain Senſe of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; Nothing can make it literally true but <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bread</hi> is one Body, one corporeal Subſtance: The <hi>Flesh</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Body, another corporeal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Change that into this; You change one <hi>Body</hi> into another, one <hi>Subſtance</hi> into another; And then, I pray, What change is this, if it be not <hi>Subſtantial?</hi> What is it, if it be not <hi>Tranſubſtantiation?</hi> Tis clear, that when the Fathers of the firſt four Ages ſpeak of the wonderfull change made in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> they ſpeak of the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62850:56"/>change of <hi>Bread</hi> into the <hi>Flesh</hi> or <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> They ſpeak not, of an <hi>Accidental</hi> change, but a <hi>Subſtantial</hi> one, which now the Church calls <hi>Tranſubſtantiation:</hi> And therefore I have nothing more to do but cite the <hi>Fathers</hi> words, &amp; ſo conclude.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Gaudentius</hi> is his 2. <hi>Tract</hi> upon <hi>Exodus,</hi> ſays, <hi>He, the Creator &amp; Lord of Nature, who produces bread out of the earth, produces alſo his own proper body out of bread, becauſe he can do it, &amp; promis'd to do it: And He who produc'd wine out of water, produces alſo his blood out of wine.... For when he gave the conſecrated bread &amp; wine to his diſciples, He ſaid; This is my Body, This is my Blood. Let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him whom we have believ'd; Truth cannot tell a lie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Chryſoſtom</hi> in his 83. <hi>homilie</hi> upon <hi>S. Matthew,</hi> has theſe excellent words; <hi>Let us every where believe God Almighty; nor contradict him, although what He ſays ſeem contrary to our Reaſon and our Eyes..... His word cannot deceive us; Our Senſe is eaſily deceiv'd: That never erres. This often is miſtaken. Since therefore He ſays, This is my Body; Let us be perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62850:56"/>of it, &amp; believe it.... Theſe are not the works of human power. He who did theſe things at his laſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, He it is who now performs them. We only are his Miniſters; 'tis He that Sanctifies, He that Tranſmutes the bread &amp; wine into his Body &amp; Blood.</hi> So that, as the ſame <hi>Saint</hi> ſays in his 25. <hi>homily</hi> upon the 1. to the <hi>Corinthians, That, which is in the Chalice, is that which flow'd from his ſide, &amp; that we are partakers of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>S. Ambroſe in his book <hi>De his qui myſteriis initiantur;</hi> ch. 9. <hi>Perhaps you'l ſay,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I ſee quite another thing: How do you aſſure me that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Body of Chriſt? And this is that which remains for us to prove. How great,</hi> ſays he, <hi>are the examples which we uſe to shew, that it is not the thing which Nature form'd, but the thing which the Bleſſing has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated; and that the Bleſſing has greater force than Nature; becauſe, by the Bleſſing, even the Nature it ſelf is chang'd.</hi> Afterwards He inſtances in the change of <hi>rods</hi> into <hi>Serpents,</hi> and of <hi>water</hi> into <hi>blood;</hi> and thus purſues his diſcourſe. <hi>If,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the word of Elias was powerfull enough to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62850:57"/>fire down from Heaven, shall not the word of Chriſt be able to change the Nature of the Elements? You have read, of the whole Creation; He ſaid, &amp; they were made, He commanded, &amp; they were created: The Word there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Chriſt, which could make out of nothing that which was not; cannot it change thoſe things which are, into what they were not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Gregory Nyſſen</hi> in his <hi>Catechiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Diſcourſe,</hi> ch. 37. profeſſes the ſame faith: <hi>I do believe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that by the word of God, the Sanctified bread is tranſmuted into the Body of God the Word ... Not that by mediation of nourishment it becomes the body of the Word; but that immediatly by the Word it is tranſmuted into his body, by theſe words, This is my Body.... the Nature of the things, which appear, being tranſelemented,</hi> that is, tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated, <hi>into it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Cyril</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> in his 4. <hi>Myſtagogick Catechiſe,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes thus: <hi>Do not conſider it as meer bread &amp; wine; for now it is the Body &amp; Blood of Chriſt according to our Lord's own words. Although your Senſe ſuggeſt</hi> otherwiſe, <hi>let your faith
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62850:57"/>confirm you, that you may not judge the thing by the Taſt....</hi> and a little after, he goes on; <hi>knowing,</hi> ſays he, <hi>&amp; holding for certain, that the bread which we ſee, is not bread, although it taſt like bread; &amp; the wine which we ſee, is not wine, although it taſt like wine. S. Hierome</hi> in his <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi> &amp; <hi>Theodoret</hi> in his 2. <hi>Dialogue,</hi> are witneſſes that <hi>S. Cyril</hi> was the Author of this work. And now I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the judgment of my Auditory, whether I may not venture to defy any <hi>Catholick</hi> of this preſent Age, to expreſs in plainer terms our Faith of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* However, Tis very ſtrange, (you'l ſay) if this were the faith of the firſt Ages, that None of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> nor ſo much as <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtat,</hi> should take notice of it. This, if we believe a late Author, <hi>is to a wiſe man inſtead of a thouſand Demonſtrations, that no ſuch doctrine was then believ'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* As for <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtat;</hi> Of three books, which he wrote, we have but one, &amp; that imperfect. Had he objected it, 'tis certain <hi>S. Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> never would have
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62850:58"/>taken notice of it in his <hi>Anſwer:</hi> So cautious he is in ſpeaking, even of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> that he paſſes it over in theſe terms; <hi>I should ſay many more things.... if I did not fear the ears of the profane. For commonly they laugh at things they cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* As for the <hi>Heathens,</hi> 'tis ſufficient to reflect what care was taken by the primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to hide the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of our Religion, &amp; to keep our books out of the hands of Infidels. This privacy of ours made <hi>Celſus</hi> call our Doctrine <hi>Clancular:</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> in his firſt book againſt him, anſwers that <hi>it is proper, not only to Chriſtian Doctrine, but alſo to Philoſophy, to have ſome things in it, which are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to every one. Tertullian,</hi> in his 4. book, <hi>Ad Uxorem,</hi> ch. 5 for this reaſon, would not allow <hi>Chriſtian</hi> women to marry <hi>Pagan</hi> husbands: <hi>will not your Husband,</hi> ſays he, <hi>know what you taſt in Secret, before you eat of any other meat?</hi> And <hi>S. Baſil</hi> in his book Concerning the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ch. 27. ſays, that <hi>The Apoſtles &amp; Fathers in the beginning of the Church, by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62850:58"/>&amp; ſilence preſerv'd the dignity of their Myſteries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* But, becauſe my Author thinks this Demonſtration <hi>worth a Thouſand,</hi> I am the more willing to anſwer him in his own words, that <hi>though I have untied the knot, I could with more eaſe have cut it. For ſince 'tis plain &amp; evident</hi> from all the Records of the firſt eight Centuries, that <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi> always was believ'd, <hi>it is the wildeſt, and the moſt extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant thing in the world to ſet up a pretended Demonſtration of Reaſon againſt plain experience &amp; matter of Fact. This is juſt like Zeno's Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration againſt Motion, when Dioge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes walkt before his eyes. A man may demonſtrate till his head &amp; heart ake, before he shall ever be able to prove, that which certainly was, never to have been. All the Reaſon in the World is too weak to Cope with ſo tough &amp; obſtinate a difficulty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have now perform'd my promiſe. I have in three Sermons prov'd; 1. that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is neither <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to <hi>Senſe</hi> nor <hi>Reaſon;</hi> 2. that it follows clearly from the plaineſt words
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62850:59"/>in <hi>Scripture;</hi> 3. that it has been the perpetual <hi>faith</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> not only ſince <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> but ever ſince the firſt foundation of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion.</hi> And now I not only beg of you, but earneſtly conjure you by all that ought to be moſt dear to you, by all your deſires &amp; expectations of eternal Happyneſs, to conſider ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly &amp; leiſurely three fundamental principles of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>without Faith 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pleaſe God.</hi> They are the words of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ch. 11. v. 16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>there is but one Body, one Spirit, ... one Lord, one Faith.</hi> They are the words of the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> ch. 4. v. 4. &amp; 5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That we ought to follow the Direction of this <hi>one Lord,</hi> to find out this <hi>one Faith.</hi> This Direction is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> ch 6. v. 16. <hi>Thus ſays the Lord: ſtand in the ways &amp; ſee; And ask for the Old Paths, where is the good Way, &amp; walk therein; and you shall find reſt for your ſouls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tis natural for men to pleaſe
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62850:59"/>themſelves with thinking how much they are wiſer than their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours. Nothing is more agreable to Man's proud inclinations, than to be always finding faults &amp; giving ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterial directions for the mending of them: And this is that which makes the very Name of Reformation plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing &amp; delightfull. To give it its due; Reforming is a pretty Thing, if it were well applied. If every Man would make it his chief buſineſs to reform himſelf; O! what a Happy Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should we live to ſee! But this alas, is much the ſmalleſt part of all our Buſineſs. There is no Vanity, no Pleaſure, in Reforming of our ſelves: We only gain a Victory where we deſire it not; &amp; only triumph over our own faults. A proud man would as willingly ſit out, as play at ſuch ſmall game as this: All his delight is to reform his Neighbours. And here, I muſt confeſs, if Men were only a little overbuſy in reforming of their neighbours <hi>Manners,</hi> the Folly of their Pride were in ſome meaſure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable. But when our inſolence at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts the Reformation of their <hi>Faith,</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:62850:60"/>&amp; of that <hi>Church</hi> to which <hi>Divine</hi> as well as <hi>Human</hi> Laws require <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> and <hi>Submiſſion;</hi> the ſpecious Name &amp; popular Pretence will never ſanctifie the Crime. If they who, in the laſt Age, undertook the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our <hi>Church,</hi> were known to be infallible; ſome grains of blind O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience might be eaſily allow'd. But ſince they may perhaps be grievouſly miſtaken, it very much behoves you to conſider it. Tis a common ſaying; <hi>if a man cheat me once, 'tis his fault; but if he cheat me twice, 'tis mine.</hi> Tis not the firſt time that a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Party in the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> has ſeparated from the whole, upon theſe plauſible pretences of <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to correct <hi>Abuſes, Innovations,</hi> &amp; <hi>Errours.</hi> Did not the <hi>Arians,</hi> thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred years ſince, begin to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate upon this popular pretence? Did not they, in the ſame manner, amuſe their <hi>Proſelytes</hi> with plauſible ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, of <hi>errours, innovations,</hi> and <hi>abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> crept into the <hi>Church?</hi> Did not they make as great a noiſe againſt the <hi>Conſubſtantiality</hi> of God the <hi>Son?</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain as much of Spiritual <hi>Tyranny?</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:62850:60"/>inveigh as much againſt the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> for making, introducing, and impoſing, a new, unheard of, <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> of <hi>Faith:</hi> quite contrary to the belief of three preceding Ages, &amp; plainly oppoſite to <hi>Holy Writ?</hi> All This, you know, was falſe: You know that, though the <hi>word</hi> was new, the <hi>faith</hi> was old &amp; plainly prov'd by <hi>Scripture:</hi> And yet theſe popular noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which then the <hi>Arians</hi> buzz'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the peoples ears, amuſed them ſo. They never entertain'd the leaſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of their being cheated. Had our Reformers been the firſt, &amp; you had been deceiv'd, The fault had then been theirs. But, ſince the ſame trick has been playd ſo often in the <hi>Church,</hi> if now you are deceiv'd, the fault is yours. I have laid before your eyes, this day, a proſpect of the eight firſt Ages. They accuſe the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> of making a new <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith:</hi> And, by the moſt Authentick Records of Antiquity, it has been plainly prov'd that they themſelves are guilty of unmaking an old <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> as ancient as <hi>Chriſt</hi> &amp; his <hi>Apoſtles. Remember the days of old; Conſider
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62850:61"/>the years of many generations; Ask thy Father, &amp; he will shew thee; thy El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and They will tell thee. Stand in in the ways, &amp; ſee; and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, &amp; walk therein:</hi> There is no other <hi>Way</hi> which can conduct you ſafely to the Joys of Heaven; which I wish you all, <hi>in the Name of the Father, Son, &amp; Holy Ghoſt, Amen.</hi>

This was the reaſon why our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> inſtructing his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> thoſe great <hi>Hero's</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> was pleas'd to ſettle this foundation for the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure of their great &amp; glorious Actions, <hi>Without me you can do nothing.</hi> That they might better underſtand it, He compar'd them to the branches of a Vine, which being ſeparated from the Root immediatly fade &amp; wither without bringing fruit. <hi>I am the Vine, you are the Branches;</hi> Without me you are fruitleſs; Without <hi>Humility</hi> all that ſeems great &amp; glorious is but a ſplendid <hi>Bubble,</hi> a meer empty <hi>Nothing.</hi>

            <p>All this, you'l ſay, is very true: <hi>Humi'ity</hi> is never out of Seaſon. But why ſo much of it in this Day's Ghoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel? Why is it now in Seaſon, more than any other time? The Reaſon is; Becauſe no Virtue is ſo apt to puff us up with <hi>Pride,</hi> as <hi>Fortitude.</hi> A <hi>Hero,</hi> among men, is too often like <hi>Lucifer,</hi> among the Angels. From the Meridian of his aſpiring height, if he look down,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62850:62"/>'tis with Contempt, if upward, 'tis with Emulation of being like the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. No wonder, whilſt he lives and flourishes, if he deſires to be like God; For, even when he is dead, Poſterity is apt to make him ſo. Hence 'tis, the <hi>Hero's</hi> of Antiquity have peopled an imaginary Heaven with ſo many <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> and Mankind was ſo ignorantly Superſtitious as to offer <hi>Sacrifices</hi> to them. Had we not been inſtructed bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the Word of God, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by the <hi>Ghoſpel</hi> of this Day; Our Nation, for ought I know, might have been guilty of the ſame extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance: <hi>S.

But ſince all <hi>Catholicks,</hi> are well acquainted with this great &amp; fundamental Truth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the words of my Text; <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt</hi> all the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> all the <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven, <hi>can do Nothing;</hi> The Knowledge of this Truth has dasht the hopes of Hell; the Gates of it can never prevail againſt us; We cannot, if we do not quite renounce our Faith, We cannot be in danger of ſo groſſe <hi>Idolatry.</hi> My firſt deſign, in this <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,</hi> is to maintain the <hi>Honour</hi> which redounds upon <hi>S.

               <p>From a deep Senſe of this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Truth, which is the firſt founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Chriſtian Humility,</hi> the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church</hi> has ever been perſuaded that it is her Duty to appoint the Feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivals of <hi>Saints,</hi> for theſe two reaſons: 1. to offer up our <hi>humble Thanks</hi> to God, for all the ſignal inſtances of his great <hi>Power &amp; Mercy,</hi> all the <hi>Favours</hi> He ſo graciouſly beſtow'd upon his <hi>Saints,</hi> who <hi>could do nothing</hi> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: 2. to offer up our <hi>humble Prayers</hi> to God, that ſince we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are not able to do any thing without him, He may pleaſe to help us with proportionable Graces, ſuch as may enable us to follow their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Humble <hi>Thankſgiving,</hi> Humble
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62850:63"/>
                  <hi>Prayer,</hi> are the Duties of this Day-In the performance of the firſt, we raiſe our thoughts to Heaven, and contemplating this great <hi>Saint</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne of God (where he acknowledges, &amp; renders <hi>Thanks</hi> for, all the miracles of <hi>Grace,</hi> which rais'd him to ſo high a Station of Glory there) we fall devoutly down upon our knees, with admiration of God's great Mercy, &amp; <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> for the powerfull aſſiſtance which appear'd ſo ſignally in <hi>him</hi> who of himſelf was able to do Nothing. In the ſecond, we look down upon our ſelves, and conſcious of our Frailty we begin to <hi>Pray</hi> with all Humility, that ſince his Goodneſs has been heretofore ſo great, He may continue it to us: And, at the ſame time, this great <hi>Saint,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering the danger he has eſcap'd, compaſſionates the danger we are in, &amp; humbly <hi>Prays</hi> that ſince the ſame Redeemer died for him and us, the ſelfsame helps which carried on the work of his Salvation may be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployd in ours, Having thus fairly ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; divided the whole Duty of the <hi>Day,</hi> I shall proceed to juſtifie the <hi>Honour</hi> which from hence redounds
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62850:64"/>upon the <hi>Saint</hi> whoſe Feaſt we cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate.</p>
               <p>I need not tell you, that if any <hi>Saint</hi> deſerve a Feſtival in honour of his memory, <hi>S. George</hi> may very well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it from us more than any other Nation. All <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> has been am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of his Patronage; and almoſt every Part been at a holy ſtrife with one another which should honour him moſt. In <hi>Portugal</hi> they look upon him as the Souldier's Patron: In <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> we find a Military Order dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him: In <hi>Italy</hi> we have ſeen the great decay of the <hi>Italian</hi> Souldiery recover'd by <hi>S. George's</hi> Regiment. In <hi>Aſia</hi> the <hi>Georgians,</hi> which way ſoever they employ their forces, carry with them a fair Banner with the Picture of <hi>S. George</hi> upon it. In the <hi>Armenian</hi> Churches they religiouſly obſerve his Feaſt. Among the <hi>Greeks</hi> they keep the ſame Solemnity; And they who travel in thoſe parts can hardly find two Churches in a Town whereof one is not dedicated to <hi>S George.</hi> Thus have all Countries ſtudied to outvie each other in the <hi>Honour</hi> of this <hi>Saint.</hi> But as the <hi>Genius</hi> of this Nation ſutes more than any with his proper Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62850:64"/>We bid the faireſt for his Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage. What <hi>Saint</hi> more proper to be Patron of a Warlike <hi>Nation,</hi> than a Warlike <hi>Saint?</hi> A Nation whoſe Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour has been always envied &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd by all the World, what could could they want to make them <hi>Saints</hi> as well as <hi>Souldiers,</hi> but the Patronage &amp; great Example of <hi>S. George,</hi> a <hi>Souldier</hi> &amp; a <hi>Saint?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet, I know not how it comes to paſſe, there are a certain ſort of people in the World ſo ſuperſtitiouſly over-jealous of <hi>God's Honour</hi> &amp; ſo ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous in miſinterpreting their Duty to Him, that they dare not upon any terms allow the leaſt proportion of <hi>Honour</hi> to a <hi>Saint,</hi> for fear of giving <hi>God</hi> too little, &amp; the <hi>Saint</hi> too much. I do not pretend to enter now into the Liſts of Diſputation; but only to preſent you ſome few obvious reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, relating to the main Diſpute, which may contribute ſomething to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the removal of theſe groundleſs fears &amp; ſcandalous miſapprehenſions.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place; If we think as humbly and as meanly of the <hi>Saint,</hi> as he dos of himſelf, We cannot <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> be accounted guilty of Idolatry:
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62850:65"/>The <hi>Saint</hi> is then no more <hi>our Idol</hi> than he is <hi>his own.</hi> You cannot imagine that the <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven idolize themſelves: If therefore we <hi>eſteem</hi> the <hi>Saints</hi> no more than they eſteem themſelves; There is no danger (upon this account) of honouring them too much. The <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven are more <hi>humble</hi> now than ever. Tis true; They ſee God <hi>face to face;</hi> They ſee in him all they deſire to ſee: But yet this Knowledge dos not puff them up with <hi>Pride,</hi> becauſe they ſee in Him that He is <hi>All,</hi> &amp; they are <hi>Nothing.</hi> They only <hi>believ'd</hi> it upon Earth; but now they plainly <hi>ſee</hi> it. <hi>S.

If it be ſuch an <hi>Honour</hi> to this great &amp; glorious <hi>Saint,</hi> that we poor <hi>Sinners</hi> bear him Company, attend, &amp; wait upon him to the <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> to offer up our
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62850:66"/>
                  <hi>Thanks</hi> with his: Conſider well, and tell me whether or no, it be not a great <hi>Honour</hi> to us miſerable <hi>Sinners,</hi> that this great &amp; glorious <hi>Saint</hi> appears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, introduces us, preſents us to our God &amp; his, &amp; offers up his Prayer, his Petition, his Addreſs with ours? Can you imagine a more honourable <hi>Teſtimony of our Excellency,</hi> than that the Bleſſed <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven, notwithſtanding all their glorious advantages above poor <hi>Sinners,</hi> nevertheleſs eſteem ſo much, &amp; ſet ſo great a value on, God's Image in us, as to offer up their humble Supplications for us, and to interpoſe with ſuch profound Humility betwixt our angry God &amp; us, as if in Heaven they ſo highly priſed us, as to ſolemniſe <hi>Humiliation-Days</hi> in favour of us?</p>
               <p>This, I confeſs, appears to me enough to counterballance all our <hi>Holy-Day-Thankſgivings</hi> upon Earth. But I have yet more weight to put into the Scale, which will not fail to bear it down. If it be ſuch an <hi>Honour,</hi> to the <hi>Saints</hi> above, that <hi>Sinners</hi> here below keep <hi>Holy Days</hi> to celebrate their <hi>Victories</hi> with marks of joy &amp; thanks; ſurely we muſt allow that 'tis no little <hi>Honour</hi> to repentant <hi>Sinners,</hi> that the <hi>Angels</hi> and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62850:67"/>
                  <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven celebrate, with jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and thanksgiving, all the <hi>Victories</hi> of Grace by which we overcome our Enemies on Earth. I do not ſay, They keep our <hi>Holy Days;</hi> becauſe all ſuch expreſſions, transferr'd from Earth to Heaven, looſe their ſenſe, and we are always at a loſs for words, when ever we pretend to talk of things ſo far above us: But yet I am inclin'd to think that all thoſe Days, in which a Sinner is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, are <hi>Thanksgiving-Days</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 15.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.</note> 
                  <hi>There is Ioy in Heaven, There is Joy in preſence of the Angels</hi> &amp; Saints <hi>of God, over one Sinner that repenteth.</hi> Conſider this, and you will eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that we receive great <hi>honour,</hi> whilſt we give it; and that we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull, if we think we give too much.</p>
               <p>In the third, &amp; laſt place; if the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> we allow to <hi>Saints</hi> be of the <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame kind</hi> with what we do to one another. We cannot then be reaſonably ſcandaliz'd at the exceſs; we cannot, ſurely, be ſo vain as to imagine that a <hi>Saint</hi> in Heaven is not as deſerving as a Sinner upon Earth.

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62850:67"/>
                  <hi>Honour</hi> is no more <hi>Divine</hi> when we <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi> the <hi>Prayers</hi> of a <hi>Saint,</hi> than when we beg the <hi>Prayers</hi> of a <hi>Sinner:</hi> We in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure <hi>Chriſt</hi> no more when we demand their <hi>interceſſion</hi> there, than when we ask the <hi>interceſſion</hi> of our Neighbours here: The <hi>Mediatourship</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſtill the ſame, whether the <hi>Prayers</hi> of our <hi>Friends</hi> be <hi>interpos'd</hi> on <hi>this</hi> ſide, or on <hi>t'other</hi> ſide of Heaven.</p>
               <p>I cannot but reflect, whilſt I am tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thus, it may perhaps appear a little ſtrange, that I employ my time to shew how little honour we allow our <hi>Saint,</hi> when many people are in expectation of a Panegyrick to perſuade them that they cannot honour him too much. But 'tis enough for me if I have done him juſtice. I am ſure our Saint deſires no more than he deſerves; And I have ſaid enough to prove that he deſerves as much as we allow him. By our <hi>deſiring</hi> of his <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi> we do him no more honour than we do to one another. By our <hi>Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving</hi> for his Happyneſs, we only are ſo gratefull, as to honour God in him, who honours God in us. By our <hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi> of his <hi>Merit,</hi> we conceive as humble an <hi>Idea</hi> of him, as our <hi>Saint</hi> dos of himſelf; and are, in that reſpect, as innocent as he.</p>

               <p>O! what a Joy it is to a dejected <hi>Sinner,</hi> that <hi>S. George</hi> himſelf was once a <hi>Man</hi> infirm &amp; frail as well as we; &amp; that the Difference which now we ſo admire betwixt him &amp; our ſelves, is not in any Excellency he can boaſt of, but a pure effect of God's great Mercy to him. Tis true here, what <hi>S Bernard</hi> ſaies upon the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; <hi>This Man was once like us; fram'd of the ſame clay,</hi> caſt in the ſame mould, and ſubject to the ſame infirmities of Flesh &amp; Blood: <hi>We have reaſon to rejoyce, &amp; to be asham'd: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce that He is gone before us, &amp; be asham'd that,</hi> though we may, <hi>we will not follow his Example;</hi> Which is an Obligation incumbent upon All, &amp; particularly thoſe of his Profeſſion, as I shall shew you in the ſecond part of my Diſcourſe.</p>

Alas! what great encouragement to

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62850:75"/>the other in depreſſing of the Council. But yet I am not of opinion that this was the only difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt them. <hi>Pallavicini</hi> had the freedom of the <hi>Vatican</hi> Archives; He referrs himſelf to the Records of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, &amp; the writings of<note n="*" place="bottom">He ſetts down their names, <hi>l. 8. c. 10. n. 14.</hi>
               </note> ſuch Perſons as were Members of it: Moreover. He is ſo far from being partial, that<note n="*" place="bottom">D. <hi>Still.</hi> Rat. Account.</note> 
               <hi>Aquilino</hi> ſays He has done the Church more diſſervice by his <hi>Anſwer,</hi> than his Adverſary had done by his <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> As for your friend <hi>Soave,</hi> I am afraid he's apt to make the worſt of things, even when he ſpeaks truth as to the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. His intimate acquaintance with the Archbishop of <hi>Spalatro,</hi> &amp; his correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency with the <hi>French Huguenots.</hi> are enough to make me ſuſpicious of him. If you tell me, he was a <hi>Popish Frier.</hi> I muſt mind you, that he was a <hi>Venetian Papiſt,</hi> that he lived in a time of great diſſentions betwixt the State of <hi>Venice</hi> and the Pope, &amp; that he was even then engaged in writing againſt the Pope's proceedings. Tis hard to ſay how much he was a friend to the <hi>Church,</hi> But any man may ſee how bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62850:75"/>an enemy he was to the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> He liked well enough to be medd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with State-Affairs, &amp; the Senators conſulted him as an Oracle: which unuſual honour was enough to make him proud &amp; factious; and, whether it did or not, He only knows who ſees men's hearts. However all this put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether is enough to make me ſuſpect him. <hi>Pallavicini,</hi> you'l ſay, being of the Court-party deſerves to be ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted too. But, if that be all you have to ſay againſt him, we will not quarrel about preliminaries, nor looſe time in diſputing what grains of allowance are due to each of them. Upon condition you'l believe your friend <hi>Soave</hi> when he ſpeaks well of the Council, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to believe <hi>Pallavicini</hi> whenſoever he ſpeaks ill of it.</p>
            <p>You remember how eaſily, when I ſaw you laſt, you agreed with me, that <hi>if the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>were as General, as free, and as legal in all it's circumſtances, as the firſt four Councils were, you muſt needs own your ſelf obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in conſcience, to ſubmit to it, &amp; to leave of Proteſting againſt it</hi> 'Twas fair &amp; reaſonable, &amp; what I might expect from a Son of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England:</hi>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:62850:76"/>I deſired no more in hand, but was willing to give credit for the reſt.</p>
            <p>I might have told you that if the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil had been only Patriarchal; it would have bound the English Reformers to the obedience of non-contradiction. Three Brittish Bishops ſate in the 1.

We find them alſo afterwards in the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> where voting by Nations the English were one of the four in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning theſe doctrines of <hi>Huſs</hi> &amp; <hi>Wickliff,</hi> that <hi>The Pope is not the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Vicar of Chriſt,</hi> &amp; that <hi>The chief Bishop of the Roman Church has no Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

A General Council requires, either the preſence of all the Catholick Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, or their Legates, with the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops of ſo many Provinces as can well convene, or their Delegates; or elſe (in their neceſſary abſence) it requires that the Acts &amp; Decrees be approved, either by all, or by the major part of the abſent Prelates.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As for ſuch a General Council as comprehends all the Bishops of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Univerſe, there never was yet any. We find always a greater or leſſer number, according to divers cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; propinquity of place, peace of Princes, numeroſity of Sects, &amp;c. The firſt four Councils, of <hi>Nice, Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Epheſus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> by reaſon of the Oriental Hereſies, were held in the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62850:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>Eaſt, &amp; conſiſted principally of Oriental Bishops. In the I. were preſent only the Pope's two Legates, &amp; three Weſtern Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops. The II. had no Weſtern Bishop at all, but only was afterward confirm'd by the Pope &amp; his Council. The III. had only three Delegates, ſent by the Pope &amp; his Occidental Council. They tranſacted moſt of their buſineſs, &amp; condemn'd <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> without the preſence of the <hi>Antiochian</hi> Patriarch. The IV. had only four Legates ſent by the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> two <hi>African</hi> Bishops, &amp; one <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian.</hi> They acted without <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Patriarch. They depoſed him for favouring Hereticks, &amp; for his contumacy againſt the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If all <hi>Catholick</hi> Prelates, or the much greater part, be perſonally preſent in the Council, there's no need of far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acceptation to confirm it. But, this wanting, 'tis ſupplied by the after-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of ſuch perſons as are capable of a vote, and ſo many as, if they had been preſent, would have made it the much greater part of <hi>Catholick</hi> Prelates, that is, of ſuch as were not before shut of the Church by Hereſie or Schiſme. The II. &amp; V. General Councils became ſuch by the confirmation &amp; after accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62850:77"/>of <hi>Damaſus</hi> &amp; <hi>Vigilius</hi> with their Weſtern Bishops; and 'tis a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental principle of Government not ſimply Monarchicall, that No Laws can be promulgated, no Unity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, if of their Governours the leſſer part be not regulated by the greater.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Council remains General, notwithſtanding the abſence of ſome conſiderable Churches: 1. if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conveniently come: 2. if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe without juſt hindrance: 3. if they were formerly cut of by Hereſie or Schiſme. The Catholick Church is narrower than Chriſtianity and a Council may be General, though the Church were reduced to one Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate.</p>
            <p n="5">5. All that were capable of a voice in any General Council, were ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd to <hi>Trent</hi> The Eaſtern Bishops, in the <hi>Turks</hi> Dominions could not conveniently come, there being war betwixt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> &amp; <hi>Turks.</hi> The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, which occaſion'd the Aſſembly, aroſe only in the Weſt, &amp; therefore there was leſs need of their preſence. Moreover ſix <hi>Greek</hi> Biſhops ſate in the Council: And, ten years after, the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg</hi>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:62850:78"/>Divines ſent the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to <hi>Hieremy</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> whoſe Anſwer to them differs very little from the Decrees of <hi>Trent.</hi> Tis true; <hi>Cyril Lucar</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1629.</note> publish'd a Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſtical Conteſſion: But his immediate Succeſſor <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Iberia</hi> aſſembled at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> a Synod of 23. Bishops, beſides the Patriarchs of <hi>Alexandria</hi> &amp; <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> And again, his Succeſſor <hi>Parthenius</hi> aſſembled another of 25. Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops, &amp; amongſt them the Metropolitan of <hi>Moſcovy:</hi> Both theſe Synods anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiz'd <hi>Lucar</hi> with his Adherents; and alſo juſtified theſe Tenets of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, the <hi>Corporal Preſence of Chriſt's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy &amp; Blood with the Symboles; Invocation of Saints; Veneration of ſacred Images; Prayer &amp; Almes for the Faithfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd with repentance, as betterable in their preſent condition by them; Free will; ſeven Sacraments; Church Infallibility,</hi> &amp;c. See <hi>Leo Allatius, De perpetuo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſu</hi> &amp;c. l. 3. See Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi>'s Answer to <hi>Claude</hi> l. 4 ch 7.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The abſence of the Proteſtant Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy from the Council did not hinder it's being General. 1. They who are not Bishops, have no right to ſit there. 2.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62850:78"/>When Bishops contumaciouſly abſent themſelves for fear of Cenſure, their preſence is not requiſite; otherwiſe fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well the Power of all General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. 3. There is no place due to them whoſe Doctrines have been anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd in former General Councils. <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Images</hi> was declared lawfull in the II. of <hi>Nice.</hi> Our <hi>Canon</hi> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Purgatory; Seven Sacraments,</hi> &amp; <hi>Pope's Supremacy,</hi> were defined in the Council of <hi>Florence:</hi> Auricular <hi>Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> &amp; <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> in that of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Although in the firſt Seſſions under <hi>Paul</hi> III. there were only about 48. Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops. 3. Benedictine Abbots, 5. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of Religious Orders, with about 40. able Divines by way of Counſellors: This paucity under <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Julius</hi> was amply recompenc'd by a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Prelates under <hi>Pius</hi> IV who all unanimouſly received &amp; ratified the former Acts of the Council. If you count them, you'l find in the Catalogue, 270. to which if you add the learned Divines who aſſiſted, the whole number a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to about 450. perſons.</p>
            <p n="8">8. A General Council requires, that the Pope either preſide in it; or approve
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62850:79"/>the Acts of it, as in the caſe of the II. &amp; V. General Council. In the IV. VI. VII. &amp; VIII. the Proteſtants allow that he preſided To the III. he depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted S. <hi>Cyril.</hi> To the I. he ſent his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates. <hi>Oſius,</hi> you'l ſay, ſubſcrib'd before them. 1. Tis thought he preſided in the Pope's name with them 2. If not, it was a pure indulgence of honour to him: The Legates ſubſcribed before all the Patriarchs. 3. The ſubſcriptions were manifeſtly irregular, becauſe the Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> who was the III. Patriarch, ſuſcribed after the Bishops of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> &amp; alſo thoſe of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> which were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to him. I have now done with my remarks, &amp; shall make what haſt I can with your objections, ſetting them down in the ſame order you ſent them.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Eaſtern Bishops were abſent: &amp; the Proteſtants would not go to the Council. A. 1. There were ſix <hi>Greek</hi> Bishops preſent: Afterwards three Eaſtern Patriarchs, &amp; two Aſſemblies of their Prelates approv'd the chief points. The Proteſtants had no right to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive voice: Their opinions had been cenſur'd in former Councils, and were like to be condemn'd again in this: If, for theſe reaſons, they abſented; 'twas
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62850:79"/>their own fault: The Council was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the worſe for't. 2. Read the Bulls of Convocation: you will find that <hi>all</hi> &amp; <hi>every one</hi> who, either by <hi>law,</hi> by <hi>cuſtom,</hi> or by <hi>priviledge,</hi> have any right to <hi>be preſent,</hi> or to <hi>deliver their opinion,</hi> in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils,</hi> were ſummon'd to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in <hi>Trent.</hi> 3. <hi>Soave</hi> himſelf relates how there was a deliberation of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, &amp; granting ſafe-conduct, to the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches under the <hi>Turk;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 451.</note> 
               <hi>but it was preſently ſeen,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that theſe poor men afflicted in ſervitude, could not without danger, &amp; aſſiſiance of money, think of Councils.</hi> He ſays alſo, that<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 408.</note> 
               <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Pope was put in mind, that to ſend Nuncio's into</hi> England <hi>&amp; to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces elſewhere, who do profeſs open Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the See of</hi> Rome, <hi>would be a diſreputation to him; yet he answer'd that he would humble himſelf to Hereſy, in regard that whatſoever was done to gain ſouls to</hi> Chriſt, <hi>did become that See.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. In ſome of the firſt Seſſions there were not above fifty Bishops. A. The difficulties &amp; diſturbances of the Times bear all that blame. All was fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenc'd in the end, by a numerous
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62850:80"/>&amp; unanimous ratification of all, &amp; by the acceptation of the abſent Prelates after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. <hi>Soave</hi> ſays, that, under <hi>Pius</hi> IV.<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 504.</note> 
               <hi>the Actions of this Council were in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter expectation than in former times, in regard the number of the Prelates were aſſembled four times as many as before.</hi> He ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 757.</note> 
               <hi>All the Decrees made in this Council, under</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Julius, <hi>as well of Faith as Reformation, were recited: And the Secretary going into the midſt did interrogate, whether the Fathers were pleas'd that Confirmation should be demanded of Pope</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ius IV. <hi>of all things decreed under</hi> Paul, Julius, <hi>&amp; his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and they anſwer'd, not one by one but all together,</hi> Placet. <hi>Pallavicini</hi> ſays the ſame; only he proves that<note n="*" place="bottom">l. 24. c. 8.</note> the votes were given, as uſually, one by one.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Many of the Bishops were only Titular: And many made, during the Council, that the <hi>Papalins</hi> might over-vote the <hi>Ultramontans.</hi> A. As to the firſt part; <hi>Soave</hi> takes notice only of two Titular Bishops, the Archbishop of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Upſal</hi> in <hi>Sweden;</hi> both driven from their Sees by perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Proteſtants, both true Bishops by their Ordination, and both ſent by the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62850:80"/>Pope in the beginning of the Council. The ſecond part, being barely aſſerted, locks like a groundleſs calumny, &amp; may juſtly be ſuppos'd ſuch, till ſome proof appear.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The Popes, of thoſe times, &amp; major part of the Prelates, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver allow this Title, of the Council, <hi>Repreſenting the Univerſal Church:</hi> Therefore they themſelves did not look upon it as a General Council. A. Here I muſt beg your pardon, if I think you very much miſtaken in your inference. This Title was uſurp'd by the Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> &amp; <hi>Baſil;</hi> but never aſſum'd by any Council, which was totally approv'd. You know very well, that Catholick Divines are divided upon the point; whether the Pope be ſuperior to a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; or whether a General Council, without him, be ſo compleat a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentati e of the Univerial Church, as to be ſuperior to the Pope? They who maintain'd the ſuperiority of a General Council, were zealous for this Title; and the others conſtantly oppos'd it: But both parties always agreed, that the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> was as truly <hi>General,</hi> as the firſt four Councils were, or any have been ſince.</p>
            <pb n="160" facs="tcp:62850:81"/>
            <p n="5">V. It was never receiv'd by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants:</hi> Nor by the <hi>French</hi> Catholicks. A. 1. The Council of <hi>Nice</hi> was never receiv'd by the <hi>Arians.</hi> 2 It was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally receiv'd by both <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> &amp; <hi>Civil</hi> State of <hi>France:</hi> in point of <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine</hi> 3. The Decrees of <hi>Reformation</hi> were approv'd by all the <hi>Catholick Clergy</hi> of that Kingdom. In the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at <hi>Blois,</hi> in the year, 1576. The Archbi hop of <hi>Lions</hi> in the name of all the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical State</hi> of <hi>France</hi> begg'd the <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> of the <hi>King's Authority</hi> to <hi>put this Reformation in execution.</hi> In the Aſſembly of <hi>Melun,</hi> 1579. the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Bazas,</hi> in their name, made the ſame requeſt to the King, <hi>chiefly becauſe they are tied &amp; bound to all Laws, ſo made by the Catholick Church, upon pain of being reputed Schiſmatical, &amp; of incurring the curſe of Eternal Damnation.</hi> At <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainebleau</hi> in the year, 1582. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Bourges</hi> tells the King, <hi>The ſtain &amp; reproach of Schiſm reſts upon your Kingdom amongſt other Countries. And this is the cauſe, why the Clergy doth now again moſt humbly deſire,</hi> &amp;c. In the General Aſſembly of the States at <hi>Paris,</hi> in the year, 1614. Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> &amp; Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> then Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62850:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>of <hi>Luſon,</hi> proſecuted in vain the ſame requeſt. Thus you ſee the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Clergy</hi> of <hi>France</hi> unanimouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving &amp; approving the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in matter of <hi>Diſcipline.</hi> The <hi>Civil State,</hi> as it has no share in the Votes of the Council, ſo their non-appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation cannot diminish the Authority of it. You may gueſs at the reaſons of excepting againſt it, by what the Queen Regent, <hi>Catherine de Medicis,</hi> was pleas'd to tell the Pope's <hi>Nuncio;</hi> that <hi>the Council could not be admitted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the Council's Decrees the King could not gratifie ſuch Miniſters of State, as had done him ſingular ſervice, with the means of Religious Houſes, &amp; of Church. Benefices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>Leo</hi> X. before the Convocation of the Council, had declar'd that <hi>Luther</hi> &amp; his <hi>Adherents</hi> were Hereticks: Being therefore already condemn'd, why should they come to Council? A. 10 Their Errors had been condemn'd in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer General Councils: and, ſince it real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was ſo, Why might not the Pope ſay ſo 12. <hi>Becauſe</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> had condemn'd them <hi>therefore</hi> they<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Scave</hi> p. 11.</note> appeal'd to a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council:</hi> and, ſince they had <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd</hi>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:62850:82"/>to it, Why should they not <hi>go</hi> to it?</p>
            <p n="7">VII. It was not a legal Council. A. That is to ſay, it was not ſuch a one as they had a mind to. <hi>Luther,</hi> being que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd, firſt made friends to be tried in <hi>Germany.</hi> As ſoon as he was there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by <hi>Cajetan,</hi> he appeal'd to the Pope. Immediatly after, foreſeeing his condemnation there, he intercepted this appeal with<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>ibid.</hi> p. 8.</note> another, from the Pope to a General Council; having ground to imagine, He would never call one, who was ſuppos'd, to fear that it would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely reform him &amp; his Court. As ſoon as he ſaw that, in good earneſt, a Bull was publisht, in the year, 1537. to call a Council at <hi>Vicenza;</hi> he began preſently, to vilifie Councils, &amp; put out a book <hi>De Conciliis,</hi> to prove that they always did more harm than good; not ſparing ſo much as the firſt Councils of <hi>Nice,</hi> or of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Then he appeal'd from Council to <hi>Scripture,</hi> where He that makes himſelf ſupreme Judge of the Senſe, may eaſily maintain what ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity he pleaſes. <hi>Soave</hi> tells us, he was<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 17.</note> 
               <hi>uſed to ſay, that he was ſo well aſſured of his Doctrine, that, it being
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62850:82"/>Divine, he would not ſubmit it ſo much as to the judgment of Angels; yea, that with it he was to judge all, both men &amp; Angels.</hi> After this, his Followers thought it more plauſible not to shuffle ſo viſibly, but to admit a Council, &amp; clog it with ſuch conditions as would quite diſarm it, &amp; make it uſeleſs. You may read them in <hi>Soave,</hi> as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 600.</note>1. <hi>That it should be celebrated in</hi> Germany; 2. <hi>That it should not be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the Pope;</hi> 3. <hi>That He should not preſide, but be part of the Council, ſubject to the determinations of it;</hi> 4. <hi>That the Bishops &amp; other Prelates should be freed from their Oath given to the Pope;</hi> 5. <hi>That the Holy Scripture might be Judge in Council, &amp; all Humane Authority excluded;</hi> 6. <hi>That the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of the States of the</hi> Auguſtan Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. <hi>ſent to the Council, might not only have a conſulting, but a deciding voice;</hi> 7. <hi>That the Deciſions in Council should not be made, as in Secular mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by plurality of voices; but the more ſound opinions preferr'd, that is, thoſe which were regulated by the word of God.</hi> You will not deny, but that in <hi>England</hi> we have had ſome Kings
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:62850:83"/>whoſe title to the Crown has been unqueſtionable, &amp; that ſome free &amp; legal Parliaments have been aſſembled during their reign. Give me leave to put the caſe, that two or three Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had revolted, proteſting againſt all that would be done in ſuch a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; reſuſing to ſend any Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to it, but upon theſe conditions: 1. that it be aſſembled in their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory; 2. that it be not call'd by the King; 3. that his Majeſty may be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to it; 4. that all the members of it be freed from their Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; 5. that all Humane Authority of former Parliaments may be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; 6. that they may depute as many as they pleaſe with a deciſive voice; 7. that (for fear of being over-voted) the Deciſions be not made, as uſually, by plurality of voices, but that the more ſound opinions, (that is, their own) may be preferr'd. What would you think of theſe Articles? Would you conclude, the Parliament was illegal, if it did not ſubmit to their demands? I do not pretend here, to make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act parallel betwixt the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> &amp; that of <hi>England:</hi> yet however the parity is not ſo unequal,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62850:83"/>but that it may help to open your eyes.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. The Parties concern'd were Judges in their own caſe. A. No more than in the I. of <hi>Nice.</hi> The world was then divided into Catholicks &amp; <hi>Arians,</hi> as now into Catholicks &amp; <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> And, as the <hi>Catholicks</hi> had then a right to judge the one, ſo now they had the very ſame right to judge the other. If any part ſeparate from the whole, it does not therefore acquire a right of ſaying, that the Whole, from which they divide themſelves, is now a Party, &amp; therefore muſt not judge them. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> counteraccus'd one another of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy; and yet the Pope legally preſided in the IV. General Council which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd <hi>Dioſcorus.</hi> Neither was it ever thought a ſufficient excuſe for <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> to ſay, the Pope was a Party &amp; Judge in his own caſe.</p>
            <p>Mr: <hi>Chillingworth</hi> confeſſes, that, in controverſies of Religion, <hi>it is in a manner impoſſible to avoid but the Judge muſt be a Party. For this muſt be the firſt controverſy, whether he be a Judge or no; and in that he muſt be a Party.</hi> Such is the Pope's Caſe, in the Definition of his Supremacy. The ſame
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62850:84"/>neceſſity is found in ſupreme <hi>Civil</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. Inferiour Courts are liable to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals: But, if ſome of the King's ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects rebell againſt him, &amp; oppoſe his prerogatives or laws; 'tis evidently ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the King muſt judge his own caſe, or the Offence muſt not be judg'd at all. What muſt the King do? Subſtitute an equal number of Royaliſts &amp; Rebells? This can never be an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual proviſion for the Common Peace of Government. Or muſt he remit the arbitration to a neighbouring State? 1. This ſtate is always intereſs'd; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore partial. 2. This does not leave, within the compaſs of any Kingdom upon earth, ſufficient power to procure the common good 3. Were it allow'd in <hi>Civil</hi> Power, it cannot be applied to our preſent caſe, unleſs Controverſies in Religion could be decided out of the Church, by men of no Religion at all.</p>
            <p>In the National Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> in the year, 1618. the Low-country <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants</hi> ſeeing themſelves like to be over-voted by the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> made the ſame excuſes; ſaying, that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part of the Synod was declar'd of a contrary party; that they were already
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62850:84"/>excommunicated by them, and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they ought not to be Judges. To this, the Synod replied: that, if this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception were admitted, it would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the whole frame of Eccleſiaſtical Government: that Paſtors would be diſcourag'd from their duty of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the firſt beginnings of Hereſy, if therefore they muſt forfeit their right of giving ſuffrages, or being Judges, afterwards: that the <hi>Arians</hi> &amp; <hi>other Hereticks</hi> might ever have pleaded the ſame exception againſt the Orthodox Fathers: that Divines neither are, nor ought to be, indifferent in matters of Religion; ſo that, if only Neuters may be judges, there will be none left in the Church, and we muſt go abroad (no body knows where) to look for 'em. This was the ſubſtance of their Anſwer; which I here ſet down in the Latin, to ſatisfie your curioſity. <hi>Nunquam praxim hanc Eccleſiarum fuiſſe, ut Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores, quoties exorientibus erroribus ex officio ſe opponerent, propterea jure ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giorum, aut de illis ipſis erroribus judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candi poteſtate, exciderent Ita enim om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem everti judiciorum Eccleſiaſticorum ordinem; efficique ne Paſtores officio ſuo fideliter fungi queant . . . .

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62850:85"/>Parties be Judges in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> as well as in the Synod of <hi>Dort?</hi> If, in one caſe, the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> were oblig'd to ſubmit to the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> Why were not the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> oblig'd to ſubmit to the <hi>Catholicks</hi> in the other? The Synod was ſorc'd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſome diſparity; and, for want of a better, alledg'd this; that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> and <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> were under the <hi>ſame Magiſtracy.</hi> And, what if if they were? We are not now talking of <hi>Civil</hi> Aſſemblies, but of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical.</hi> Dos the diviſion of <hi>Civil</hi> Power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which we believe in our <hi>Creed?</hi> Or, if there be any reaſon why (when any Schiſme ariſes) the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of the <hi>Whole</hi> is devolved to the <hi>major part,</hi> does not the ſame Reaſon conclude as evidently in favour of a <hi>General,</hi> as of a <hi>National,</hi> Council?</p>
            <p n="9">IX. To make it better appear, which was the <hi>major part,</hi> the Proteſtants ought to have had a deciſive voice in Council. A. 1. <hi>Binius</hi> ſays, that the Council premitted this caution, that, if the Proteſtants were allow'd, for once, to give a <hi>Placet,</hi> it should be no prejudice to the right &amp; honour of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62850:86"/>the preſent &amp; future Councils: which looks as if the Council were not fully reſolv'd to deny this to them, if much inſiſted upon. 2. They, who openly maintain ſuch doctrines as have been formerly condemn'd in General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, are cutt of from the Catholick Church; they are not Members of it; &amp; therefore can have no right to a deciſive voice. 3. If it had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, they were ſtill certain to be over-voted by 270. Biſhops; to whom if you add the Catholick Divines, by the ſame rule as the Proteſtants, there remain'd no ground for any hopes. This the Proteſtants ſaw well enough, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were willing to wave all <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical</hi> Judges. <hi>Soave</hi> tells you, how they shuffled in this point.

Judge you, what a <hi>free</hi> &amp; <hi>godly</hi> Council this was like to be. Mean time, all this was only a copy of their countenance. They clearly foreſaw that the much greater part, of thoſe to whom God has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the care of his Church, would certainly condemn their errors: They were already ſelf-condemn'd, as to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; And therefore they never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to appear in any legal Council, but hated the very thought of it: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

            <p>The Duke of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> was more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, when <hi>Canobius</hi> came to invite him; He<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 413.</note> 
               <hi>anſwer'd</hi> plainly, without any mincing or diſguiſing of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>that he was of the</hi> Auguſtan <hi>Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, &amp;</hi> therefore <hi>could not conſent to a Popish Council.</hi> Yet, after all, to do the Proteſtants juſtice, I muſt needs confeſs that, as ſoon as they were no longer in fear of the Emperour, they began to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask &amp; ſpeak as plainly as the Duke did. Read <hi>Soave</hi>'s Annals, 1562. he ſays that,<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 599.</note> 
               <hi>ſo ſoon as the Diet was aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in</hi> Francfort, <hi>the Prince of</hi> Condé <hi>ſent to treat an union of the</hi> Huguenots <hi>with thoſe of the Confeſſion of</hi> Ausburg; <hi>and, in particular, to make a joynt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, for a free &amp; new Council, in which the reſolutions of</hi> Trent <hi>might be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, the</hi> French <hi>men of the old Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion giving hope alſo that they would agree unto it ... But the</hi>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:62850:87"/>Dutch <hi>Proteſtants were moſt averſe from a Gouncil, ſo long as</hi> Germany <hi>might be in peace without it. And therefore a book was printed in</hi> Francfort, <hi>full of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why they neither would, nor could, come to</hi> Trent, <hi>with proteſtation of the nullity of all that was, or would be, done in that place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One thing, which makes me leſs wonder they could never agree to any Council of ours, is this, that I find in <hi>Soave,</hi> they could not agree in a Council of their own.<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 411.</note> In <hi>Germany,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Princes of the</hi> Auguſtan <hi>Confeſſion, aſſembled in</hi> Neumburg, <hi>being ashamed that their Religion should be eſteem'd a Confuſion for the variety of Doctrines amongſt them, did propoſe that they might firſt agree in one, &amp; then reſolve who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ought to refuſe or accept the Synod . . . They ſaid, the</hi> Auguſtan <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion was to be the ground of their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; but, there being divers copies of that Confeſſion, which differ'd, in regard of divers additions made in divers of them, ſome approving one &amp; ſome ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Many thought they ought to take that only which was preſented to</hi> Charles <hi>in the year,</hi> 1530. <hi>Whereunto thoſe
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62850:88"/>of the</hi> Palatinate <hi>did not conſent, unleſs it were declared, in a Proheme made unto it, that the other Edition did agree with it. The Duke of</hi> Saxony <hi>anſwer'd, that they could not ſtop the eyes &amp; ears of the world, that they should not ſee &amp; hear their differences; &amp; that if they would make shew of union, where they were at variance, they should be convinc'd of vanity &amp; lying: And, after many contentions, they remain'd without agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that point.</hi> How should the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks pleaſe them, if they knew not how to pleaſe themſelves?</p>
            <p>X. The burning of <hi>John Huſs</hi> was a ſufficient excuſe for the Proteſtants, not to rely upon any Safe conduct. A. I muſt beg your pardon, if I believe no ſuch matter. It was no excuſe at all. His Safe conduct was of the <hi>ordinary</hi> form; Theirs was <hi>extraordinary:</hi> And. therefore the Caſe was quite different.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain that the <hi>Ordinary</hi> Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conducts ſecure a man only from <hi>unjuſt violence,</hi> but not from the <hi>juſt execution of a legal ſentence,</hi> if he be found guilty, When a perſon, ſuſpected of a crime, is cited to appear, &amp; to anſwer for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the <hi>Ordinary</hi> Safe-conduct ſecures him from all abuſes or affronts which
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62850:88"/>might otherwiſe be offer'd to him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther going, ſtaying, or returning: but however, if, after a fair Trial, he be legally condemn'd: it will never ſave him from ſuffering according to Law. If this were all the Security that <hi>Huſs</hi> relied upon, we may juſtly admire his confidence, in going ſo boldly to the Council; but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably wonder, either at his impriſonment, or execution.</p>
            <p>That this was all the Security given him, appears by the teſtimony of one of his own Diſciples, who wrote his <hi>Acts</hi> which are publish'd in the beginning of his Works, &amp; ſays he was an eyewitneſs of what paſs'd. He relates the words of the Emperour <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> telling <hi>Huſs</hi> to his face, at <hi>Conſtance;</hi>

               <hi>Although,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Some ſay that, by your friends &amp; patrons, you receiv'd our Letters of Publick Faith, fifteen days after your impriſonment; yet we can prove, by the teſtimony of many Princes &amp; men of chief note, that, before you left</hi> Frague, <hi>you receiv'd our Letters by</hi> Wenceſlaus <hi>of</hi> Duba. <hi>&amp;</hi> John <hi>of</hi> Chlum, <hi>to whoſe truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty care we recommended you, THAT NO INJURY MIGHT BE DONE TO YOU, but that you might ſpeak freely,

And this, you ſee, the moſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Lords, Cardinals &amp; Bishops, have ſo perform'd, that I have reaſon to give them many thanks . . . Now therefore we adviſe you, not to defend any thing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately, but to ſubmit your ſelf, with what obedience you ought, to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Holy Council. If you do this, we will endeavour, that, for our ſakes, you may be favourably diſmiſs'd by the Council. If not ... We truly will never patronize your obſtinacy &amp; your errors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this diſcourſe of the Emperour I obſerve, 1. That the <hi>Letters of Publick Faith</hi> were given to <hi>Huſs,</hi> only <hi>that no injury might be done to</hi> him: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude, that, if contrary to the common law of Safe-conducts he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to make his eſcape, his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was juſt, and no injury done. See <hi>Bremus</hi> a Proteſtant Lawyer, <hi>Quaeſt. ult. de securitate,</hi> who cites a great number of others, agreeing with him this opinion. that <hi>Publick Faith is ended or forfeited, if a man, having receiv'd Publick Faith, committs a new crime, be cauſe, for this, he may be punish'd.</hi> 2. That the friends of <hi>Huſs</hi> made no great
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:62850:89"/>ſcruple of telling ſtories in favour of him, &amp; of raiſing a falſe report that the <hi>Letters</hi> were given him the fifteenth day after his confinement; thinking, perhaps, that by this rumour the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour would be oblig'd in honour, to reſcue him out of priſon: Which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful dealing makes me leſs wonder, either that his Diſciples make no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his endeavouring to eſcape, or that the Nobles of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> take no notice of it in their Letters of complaint to the Emperour; &amp; makes me more apt to believe the Relation of it, ſet down by <hi>Ulricus Reichental,</hi> an inhabitant of <hi>Conſiance,</hi> an eye-witneſs of what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp; an accurate Hiſtorian of the Council, whom if you underſtand not in the original <hi>Teutonick,</hi> you may read this part tranſlated into <hi>Latin</hi> by <hi>Coch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeus,</hi> lib. 11. <hi>Hist. Huſſitarum,</hi> pag. 73.</p>
            <p>Before <hi>Huſs</hi> was guilty of this crime, he had been <hi>kindly receiv'd</hi> and <hi>favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably treated</hi> at <hi>Conſtance,</hi> as well as all the way thither This he confeſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in his Letters to his friends.<note n="*" place="bottom">Epiſt. <hi>5.</hi>

               <hi>the Bishop of</hi> Conſtance <hi>with his Official, came to their Lodging, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them know that the Pope ſuſpended the interdict &amp; the ſentences of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication againſt Maſter</hi> John; <hi>deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him nevertheleſs, that, to avoid ſcandal &amp; diſcourſe of the People, he would abſent himſelf from the ſolemn ſervices of the Maſs; otherwiſe, that he might freely go about to ſee the Town, the Churches, or any other places, at he pleaſed.. We have,</hi> ſays he, <hi>full liberty in</hi> Conſtance.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, as <hi>Ulricus</hi> relates it, <hi>the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62850:90"/>people flock'd together, to hear</hi> Huſs <hi>ſay Maſs in his Lodging;</hi> which being a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous thing, (he having been excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated for Hereſy, &amp; not having yet juſtified himſelf) <hi>the Bishop of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>as Ordinary of the place, prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited</hi> his doing ſo: But, <hi>Huſs</hi> ſtill perſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>to celebrate, &amp; the Bishop forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the people to be preſent,</hi> he began to look upon it as an evil <hi>omen</hi> of his future condemnation, and reſolv'd to contrive his eſcape. <hi>Upon the third Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in Lent, when</hi> Huſs <hi>did not appear at dinner,</hi> Latzembock <hi>went immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Governour of the City, and complain'd of the flight of</hi> John Huſs. <hi>The gates being shut,</hi> &amp; ſearch made, <hi>Huſs</hi> was <hi>found hid in a Cart</hi> of the ſame <hi>Latzembock,</hi> where he lay cover'd <hi>with hay &amp; ſtraw,</hi> which had been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to be tranſported out of town, that afternoon. <hi>Latzembock</hi> made <hi>him</hi> be <hi>ſet on horſe back, &amp; brought him to the Pope's Palace. He pleaded, that, having Safe-conduct, he ought not to be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd.</hi> But this Noble <hi>Bohemian</hi> (who knew very well what Safe-conduct he had, he being committed to his care, by <hi>Sigiſmond</hi>) anſwer'd, <hi>'Tis ſo Decreed, that either you muſt juſtifie your Cauſe,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62850:91"/>that it is not heretical; or die, unleſs you renounce it.</hi> I do not ſay, this was not ſevere; The Imperial Laws are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere enough: but yet, ſince it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Common Law of <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> Safe-conducts, it cannot be truly call'd an <hi>Injury,</hi> And, by the ſame rule, that the Emperour was not oblig'd, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Letters, <hi>to patronize his obſtinacy &amp; his errors,</hi> neither was he oblig'd to protect him from the courſe of Common Law in this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs I am apt to believe, that the Emperour did really deſign to procure (as much as he could, by fair means) more favour for him than the rigour of the Law allow'd. Among other reaſons which incline me to this opinion, theſe two may ſuffice at preſent: 1. that <hi>John Chlum</hi>

Neither was it lawfull for me to ſpeak any more, of this Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; becauſe, by ſo doing, the Council would have been diſſolv'd.</hi> Thus He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf; And, whether it were Vanity, or Generoſity, or Policy, that moved him, is not my buſineſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; Tis enough for your ſatisfaction &amp; mine, that, by his <hi>Letters of Publick Faith,</hi> He was not oblig'd, either in Conſcience, or in Honour, to reſcue him out of the hands of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> but only to protect him from <hi>Unjuſt Violence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tis incredible, you'l ſay, that <hi>Huſs</hi> should be ſuch a fool as to go to <hi>Conſtance</hi> upon theſe terms. Neither can I deny but that it muſt be ſome degree of folly for any man to be ſo confident of his own abilities as to cope with a whole Council, &amp; to defie all his Oppoſers to convince him of his errors.

            <p>That this was the <hi>Ordinary form</hi> of all Safe-conducts, granted according to Common Law, appears evidently by the general conſent of Lawyers; among which, for your better ſatisfaction, I shall cite only ſuch as were Proteſtants. <hi>Bremus,</hi> q. 7. <hi>de Securitate,</hi> ſays, this is the common Imperial form of Safe-conducts; <hi>Damus tibi Fidem Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam, cauſam dicendi in Judicio, CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRA VIM, NON CONTRA JURIS EXECUTIONEM.

            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Huſs</hi> had no Safe-conduct from the <hi>Pope,</hi> he expreſſely acknowledges, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 6. <hi>I came,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to</hi> Conſtance, <hi>without Safe conduct from the Pope.</hi> That he had none from the <hi>Council,</hi> appears not only by his ſilence, but by <hi>Soave</hi>'s Hiſtory, <hi>pages,</hi> 298. <hi>&amp;</hi> 307.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62850:93"/>which I shall cite in the following Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. That the Safe-conduct, which he had from the <hi>Emperour,</hi> was never intended to hinder the Council's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding againſt him, according to the Canons, is manifeſt, not only by what has been already ſaid, but by the Emperour's <hi>Letters of Publick Faith,</hi> dated from <hi>Spire,</hi> Octob. 18. 1414. extant in <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſtus</hi> his <hi>Appendix Documentorum ad Commentarios de Regni Bohemiae Juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus &amp; Privilegiis.</hi> p. 81. <hi>We heartily recommend, to all &amp; every one of you, the honourable Maſter</hi> John Huſs <hi>Batch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elor of Divinity, &amp; Maſter of Arts, the Bearer of Theſe, whom We have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into Our protection &amp; Safeguard of the Holy Empire, paſſing from the Kingdom of</hi> Bohemia <hi>to the General Council which is shortly to be held in the City of</hi> Conſtance: <hi>Deſiring you to receive him kindly, &amp; treat him favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, whenſoever he shall come unto you, and that you will &amp; ought to shew your readineſs, in promoting what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to his ſpeed &amp; ſafety, either by Land or Water, permitting alſo, him, his ſervants, his horſes, &amp; all things elſe belonging to him, freely, &amp; without any hindrance, to paſſe, to ſtop, to ſtay, &amp; to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62850:93"/>return, by any paſſages, ports, bridges, lands, dominions, juriſdictions, cities, towns, caſtles, villages, &amp; whatſoever places of yours, without any expence of tribute, toll, or any other payment; And, that you will, &amp; ought, for the honour &amp; reſpect of our Majeſty, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Secure &amp; Safe conduct for him &amp; his, when occaſion shall require.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this the Emperour commanded, as much as lay in Him, And, in all this, his ſubjects obeyd, as much as lay in them. He had no Authority over the Council, in matters of Religion: Nor do I find the leaſt ſyllable of any promiſe, made by the Emperour to him, that the Council should not proceed againſt him, according to Law. He came upon his good behaviour, and in his own defence; confiding in his own prudence and abilities, as well as in the Emperour's Letters; in which there is no ſign of theſe two promiſes, 1. that he should not be impriſon'd, if by any miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he deſerv'd it; 2. that he should not be executed, if legally condemn'd.</p>
            <p>Both theſe promiſes were plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Safe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct which the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Council granted to the <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62850:94"/>as I told you in the beginning, The Caſe was quite different. Read <hi>Soave,</hi> and if you believe him, you'l begin to be asham'd of your objection.<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 348, <hi>Conc. Trid Seſſ.</hi> 15. &amp; 18.</note> 
               <hi>The Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod doth make Faith to all Prieſts, Princes, &amp; Perſons of what condition ſoever ... Safe conduct, to come, remain, PROPOSE, &amp; ſpeak IN THE SY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOD, to HANDLE &amp; EXAMINE WHAT THEY THINK FIT. give Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, &amp; confirm them, ANSWER the OBJECTIONS of the Council, &amp; DIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PUTE with thoſe, whom it doth elect, declaring that the CONTROVERSIES in this Council shall be handled accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the HOLY SCRIPTURE, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the APOSTLES, approv'd COUNCILS, Conſent of the CATHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LICK CHURCH, &amp; Authority of the Holy FATHERS; adding, that they SHALL NOT BE PUNISH'D upon PRETENCE OF RELIGION, or OF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FENCES COMITTED, or which WILL BE COMMITTED ... and shall RETURN, when it shall ſeem good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, WITHOUT LET, with SAFE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY OF THEIR ROBE, HONOUR, &amp; PERSONS, but with the knowledg of the Deputies of the Synod, that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62850:94"/>proviſion may be made for their Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: granting that, in this Safe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, ALL thoſe CLAUSES be held to be included, which are NECESSARY FOR REAL &amp; FULL ASSURANCE: Adding, that if any</hi> of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, <hi>either in coming, or in Trent, or in returning, SHALL COMMIT ANY ENORMITY, which shall NUL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIFIE THE BENEFIT OF THIS PUBLICK FAITH, he shall be PU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NISH'D BY THEIR OWN</hi> Proteſtant <hi>JUDGES, ſo that the Synod may be ſatisfied: and, on the other ſide, if any</hi> Catholick <hi>in coming hither, remaining here, or returning, SHALL COMMIT ANY THING which may VIOLATE THIS SAFE CONDUCT, he shall be punish'd by the Synod, WITH AP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PROBATION OF THE GERMAN</hi> Proteſtant<hi>'s THEMSELVES, who shall be preſent in Trent.... which things it promiſeth faithfully, in the name of all faithfull Chriſtians, Eccleſiaſtical &amp; Secular.</hi> If <hi>Huſs</hi> &amp; <hi>Jerome</hi> had come to <hi>Conſtance</hi> with ſuch a Safe-conduct, they had neither been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd, nor executed. With ſuch a one as this, the <hi>Bohemians</hi> went after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to <hi>Baſil,</hi> were civilly uſed, &amp;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:62850:95"/>return'd quietly home. With this the <hi>Wittenberg</hi> Proteſtants went to <hi>Trent,</hi> remain'd quiet there, &amp; return'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out receiving any affront. That no more of the Proteſtants follow'd their example, in going thither, was their own fault: They knew very well, they might have gone, remain'd, &amp; return'd, ſecurely, if they pleas'd. Conſider all this, at leiſure; and then, tell me (if you can) what's become of your Excuſe.</p>
            <p>XI. The Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> &amp; <hi>Sienna</hi> had declared it lawfull to break the faith of any Safe-conduct what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. A. Read the Decrees; you'l plainly ſee the contrary. The Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> dos not ſay, 'tis lawfull for any, whoſoever they are, to violate the faith of their promiſes; but only declares, that no <hi>Secular</hi> Power can legally hinder the exerciſe of <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical</hi> Juriſdiction, becauſe it is, not only independent of it, but manifeſtly ſuperior to it, in matters of Religion. Tis a common Maxim of the Law; <hi>Superior legibus aut pactis Inferioris non ligatur.</hi> And, in all appearance, the deſign of the Council was to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the World, that, although the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:62850:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>Emperour had pretended to grant an <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Safe-conduct, ſuch as exempts a man from <hi>Juſtice</hi> as well as <hi>Violence,</hi> it could not have hindred the ſupreme Power of Pope &amp; Council from proceeding according to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, in Cauſes which are purely of Religion.</p>
            <p>This was the reaſon why the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants would not rely upon the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's Safe-conduct; Nor can I blame them for it. See <hi>Soave,</hi> p. 298. <hi>Duke</hi> Maurice <hi>wrote to the Emperour, that his Safe-conduct was not ſufficient. For, in the Council of</hi> Conſtance, <hi>it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd, that THEY MIGHT PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CEED AGAINST THOSE THAT CAME TO THE COUNCIL, THOUGH THEY HAD SAFE-CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DUCT FROM THE EMPEROUR.</hi> And that, therefore <hi>the</hi> Bohemians <hi>would not go</hi> Baſil, <hi>but under the Publick Faith of the whole Council.</hi> See p. 307. The Ambaſſadors <hi>went all together to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents,</hi> &amp; told them, that <hi>the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had given</hi> the Proteſtants <hi>a Safe-conduct, but that they were not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it, alledging that it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in the Council of</hi> Conſtance, <hi>and really executed, that THE COUNCIL
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62850:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>IS NOT BOUND BY THE SAFE-CONDUCT OF ANY, WHOSOEVER HE BE; &amp; therefore they required one from the Synod.</hi> Theſe Proteſtants, you ſee, underſtood the Council in the ſame ſenſe as I do: How come you to underſtand it otherwiſe?</p>
            <p>Let the <hi>Decree</hi> ſpeak for it ſelf, &amp; judge caſe betwixt us. It runs thus: <hi>Preſens Sancta Synodus, ex QUOVIS SALVO CONDUCTU per Imperato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, Reges, &amp; alios Seculi Principes, HAERETICIS vel de Haereſi diffama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, putantes eoſdem ſic a ſuis errori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus revocare, quocunque vinculo ſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrinxerint, CONCESSO, NULLUM Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei Catholicae, vel JURISDICTIONI ECCLESIASTICAE, praejudicium gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rari, vel IMPEDIMENTUM PRAES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TARI POSSE ſeu DEBERE declarat, QUOMINUS dicto Salvo-conductu non obſtante, LICEAT JUDICI competen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti &amp; ECCLESIASTICO de hujuſmodi perſonarum erroribus IN QUIRERE. &amp; aliàs contra eos DEBITE PROCE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERE, eoſdemque PUNIRE, QUAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUM JUSTITIA SUADEBIT, ſi ſuos errores revocare pertinaciter recuſave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint, etiamſi de Salvo conductu confiſs ad locum vonerint Judicii, aliàs non
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62850:96"/>venturi: Nec ſic promittentem, cum fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerit quod in ipſo eſt, ex hoc in aliquo remanſiſſe obligatum.</hi> Conc. Conſt. <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>The Council does not ſay, that any one, who makes a promiſe, is not obliged in conſcience to keep it, to the utmoſt of his juſt &amp; lawfull power: But only declares, that every man's Promiſes, &amp; Obligations of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, are confined within the limits of his own Juriſdiction, which he cannot lawfully exceed; And that, therefore, No man either can promiſe, or be by promiſe oblig'd to perform, any more. This is the plain ſenſe of thoſe words: <hi>Nec ipſum promittentem</hi> Imperatorem, Regem, vel alium quem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis Seculi Principem, <hi>cum fecerit quod in ipſo eſt,</hi> quod nimirum, ex officio, &amp; jure ſuo, poteſt ac debet, <hi>ex hoc</hi> Salvo conductu, <hi>in aliquo,</hi> quod Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictioni obſit Eccleſiaſticae, <hi>remanſiſſe</hi> ulteriùs <hi>obligatum.</hi> Can you blame this Doctrine? Does not every body know, 1. that any man <hi>may</hi> promiſe, &amp; every man <hi>ought</hi> to perform, what lies in his power? 2. that no man can, either promiſe to encroach upon a power ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to his own, or be oblig'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it?</p>
            <pb n="192" facs="tcp:62850:97"/>
            <p>The 1. <hi>Act</hi> of the Council of <hi>Sienna</hi> proceeds upon the ſame principles. Though it was very inconſiderable in its iſſue &amp; concluſion, it was General in its convocation &amp; deſign; It imitated the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> in aſſuming the Title of <hi>Repreſenting the Univerſal Church;</hi> And, by vertue of the ſupreme Eccleſiaſtical Power implied in that Title, They commanded All Governours Eccleſiaſtical &amp; Secular, to proſecute the Laws againſt the followers of <hi>Huſs</hi> &amp; <hi>Wickliff,</hi> revoking &amp; forbidding all <hi>priviledges, immunities, exemptions, &amp; Safe-conducts</hi> whatſoever; <hi>Privilegiis, Exemptionibus, Immunitatibus, SAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIS CONDUCTIBUS, a quibuſcumque Perſonis, Eccleſiaſticis vel Secularibus, etiamſi Pontificali, Imperiali, Regali, aut Ducali; aut aliâ quâcumque Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticâ vel Seculari praeſulgeant dignita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, conceſſis vel concedendis, NON OB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTIBUS QUIBUSCUNQUE.</hi> You may look upon this Perſecuting Decree as a ſevere thing, &amp; blame it (if you pleaſe) upon that account: But you cannot juſtly blame the Doctrine upon which 'tis grounded, it being the very ſame with that of the Council of <hi>Conſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="193" facs="tcp:62850:97"/>
            <p>If you ask me, Why then dos the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> inſert this clauſe in the end of the Safe-conduct, that<note n="*" place="bottom">p 348.</note> 
               <hi>the Synod shall not uſe, or ſuffer any to uſe, any authority, power, right, ſtatute, or priviledg, of laws, canons, or Councils, ESPECIALLY that of</hi> Conſtance, <hi>&amp; of</hi> Sienna; <hi>which things, in this behalf, &amp; for this time, the Council doth diſallow?</hi> Why dos it <hi>diſallow</hi> theſe Statutes, if they were fair &amp; juſt? A. It dos not diſallow them <hi>abſolutely,</hi> but only <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally;</hi> that is, <hi>IF</hi> they contain any doctrine contrary to the Security of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith. The reaſon of this procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was, becauſe among the Proteſtants there were a great many who had an ill opinion of theſe Decrees, and were very jealous of them. 'Twas more eaſy for the Council to proteſt, that, whatſoever they were, they should not prejudice the Safe-conduct; than it was, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them that the Decrees were inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. It was the charitable deſign of the Council to uſe all condeſcenſion poſſible, and give ſuch an <hi>extraordinary</hi> Safe-conduct, as might prevent all jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies &amp; take away all excuſes. And here it is, that the Synod might juſtly
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:62850:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſay, what the Pope ſaid upon other occaſion, They<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 408.</note> 
               <hi>humbled themſelves to Hereſy, in regard that whatſoever was done to gain ſouls to Chriſt, did become that</hi> Council.</p>
            <p>If you have a mind to ſee a great deal more of this charitable conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion towards them, read <hi>Soave</hi>'s Hiſtory, where he tells you how, the Council having granted them a Safe-conduct in the 13. Seſſion, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt it, &amp; demanded another of a more ample form, which was ſoon after granted, &amp; publish'd in the 15. Seſſion, <hi>Jan.</hi> 25. 1552. Obſerve how <hi>Soave</hi> relates it.<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 343.</note> 
               <hi>The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's Ambaſſadors deſired to have the draught of it, before it was publish'd, to shew it the Proteſtants, that if it did not give them ſatisfaction, it might be ſo amended, that they might not have an occaſion to refuſe it, as they did the other.</hi> Afterwards <hi>the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's Ambaſſadors call'd the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to them, &amp; the Ambaſſador</hi> Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavius <hi>exhorted them to give ſome little part of ſatisfaction to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, as they receiv'd much from it; told them that it was concluded, to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:62850:98"/>receive their Mandates &amp; Perſons, and to hear their Propoſitions, and to defer the concluſion of the points of Doctrine, though already diſcuſs'd &amp; digeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to expect the Divines, and hear them firſt; that they have a very am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Safe-conduct, as they deſired ... that it was neceſſary to yield ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the time, &amp; not to deſire all at once; that when they shall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the buſineſs, occaſion will make them obtain many things which before ſeem'd hard ... that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the Emperour's Ambaſſadors, have matters to propoſe of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and do ſtand only expecting that the Proteſtants should begin, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they themſelves may come forth alſo. For this cauſe he prayed them to proceed ſlowly in their demand, that the Pope should ſubmit himſelf to the Council. For the Fathers do know that there is ſomething to be amended in the Papal greatneſs; but withall, that they muſt go on cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly; that they themſelves have dayly experience, what dexterity &amp; art muſt be uſed in treating with the Pope's Miniſters Therefore let their Divines come, who should have a convenient
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:62850:99"/>audience in all things, and when they shall ſee themſelves wrong'd, it shall ever be free for them to depart. The Proteſtants retiring &amp; conſidering the draught of the Safe-conduct, were not content. They required four things more;</hi> 1. <hi>a deciſive voice;</hi> 2. <hi>that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; interpreters conformable to it, should be Judges;</hi> 3. <hi>that they might exerciſe their religion in their own hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> 4. <hi>that nothing should be done in contempt of their doctrine.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 349.</note> 
               <hi>The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts perſwaded them to go on with dexterity; ſaying, as before, that with time they should obtain all; but, ſeeking things diſtaſtfull, &amp; before there was opportunity, every thing would be more hard:</hi> that the 3. article <hi>was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be granted, becauſe it was not forbid:</hi> &amp; that the 4. <hi>was plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, becauſe good uſage was promis'd.</hi> Ambaſſador <hi>Toledo</hi> had told them,<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 344.</note> 
               <hi>that the chief importance was in the Security of coming &amp; departing; that the reſidue appertain'd to the manner of their Negotiation, which might more eaſily be concluded by the preſence of the Divines, that it was too much obſtinacy, to yield in nothing, &amp; to deſire to give
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62850:99"/>laws to the whole Church.</hi> After all this,<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 352.</note> 
               <hi>the Proteſtants receiv'd the Safe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; but, with proteſtation, that they did it, only to ſend it to their Princes.</hi> Would not any body think, theſe men were very hard to pleaſe?</p>
            <p>XII. When ſome of the Proteſtants came to <hi>Trent.</hi> they were denied au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, &amp; liberty of diſputing. A. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one, nor the other, was denied them. Tis true, they were not heard, but whoſe fault was that? It was becauſe the victorious Army of the Proteſtants made the Bishops run away from <hi>Trent,</hi> before the preliminaries of the Treaty could be well agreed upon. They came about the middle of <hi>March,</hi> &amp; departed in the beginning of <hi>April.</hi> Have but a little patience to hear <hi>Soave</hi> tell the ſtory, and you will preſently ſee that this objection is a meer calumny.<note n="*" place="bottom">ibid.</note> 
               <hi>The Electors of</hi> Mentz <hi>and</hi> Collen <hi>departed the eleventh of</hi> March.... <hi>four Divines of</hi> Wittenberg <hi>and two of</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentina <hi>came to</hi> Trent <hi>afterwards,</hi> &amp; deſired <hi>to begin the Conference. The Legat anſwer'd, that the nineteenth of</hi> March <hi>being a day appointed for the Seſſion,</hi> they would then conſider about
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62850:100"/>
               <hi>a form how to treat.</hi> Was this, denying audience? Afterwards a <hi>reſolution</hi> was <hi>taken, to prolong the Seſſion till the firſt of</hi> May. This was ſome Delay indeed, &amp; little enough to deliberate upon the preliminaries of ſo unuſual a Treaty; but however, it was no Denial. Mean time,<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 352.</note> 
               <hi>the Proteſtants often deſir'd the Action should begin</hi> (it ſeems, they were in great haſt) but <hi>difficulty was ſtill rais'd, ſometimes about the manner of treating, ſometimes about the matter with which to begin...</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 353.</note> 
               <hi>the Adherents of</hi> Ceſar, <hi>Spaniards, &amp; others, mov'd by the Emperour's Ambaſſadors, deſired to proceed; but the Papalins</hi> (he has always a fling at the Court) <hi>ſuſpecting that the end of the Imperialiſts was to come to the Reformation of the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>embrac'd all occaſions of delay. The Legate,</hi> ſays he, <hi>was thought to feign</hi> himſelf ſick; but <hi>Soave,</hi> I preſume, did not think ſo himſelf, becauſe he tells us in the very next page, that <hi>he died</hi> ſoon after at <hi>Verona,</hi> which was no good proof of his diſſimulation But let us go on with his ſtory.<note n="*" place="bottom">ibid.</note> 
               <hi>The firſt of</hi> April, <hi>the Elector of</hi> Saxony <hi>beſieg'd</hi> Ausburg, <hi>which did render it ſelf the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:62850:100"/>third day, &amp; the ſixth news came there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to</hi> Trent, <hi>&amp; that all</hi> Tirol <hi>did arm, &amp; meant to go to</hi> Inſpruc ... <hi>Therefore many of the</hi> Italian <hi>Bishops embark'd, &amp; went down the river</hi> Adice, <hi>to go to</hi> Verona, <hi>and the Proteſtan's determin'd to depart.</hi> See here the true cauſe of their departure: and tell me no more, of their being either denied audience, or liberty of diſputing.</p>
            <p>XIII. The place was not ſecure. A. Very true; it was far from being ſecure for the Catholicks: The Proteſtant Army forced them to ſuſpend the Council, <hi>April,</hi> 28. Neither was it any wonder, that they were ſo much afraid of their victorious arms: <hi>Soave</hi> ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">p 355.</note> 
               <hi>The Emperour was forced to fly by night, with all his Court from</hi> Inſpruc, &amp; <hi>to wander in the mountains of</hi> Trent, and that <hi>a few hours after,</hi> Maurice <hi>arrived there, the ſame night,</hi> &amp; <hi>made himſelf Lord of the Emperour's baggage.</hi> Conſider here, on the one ſide, how littie reaſon the Proteſtants have to complain of the choice of this place: 1. it was nigher the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of <hi>Germany,</hi> than the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of <hi>Spain</hi> &amp; <hi>France:</hi> 2. the Pope's
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:62850:101"/>forces had no acceſs thither; 'twas in the Emperour's power: 3. the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance only, of the Proteſtant Army, was enough to fright away the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. On the other ſid, you ſee how juſtly the Pope refus'd to call a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil in any City of <hi>Germany,</hi> for fear of the Proteſtant arms. As for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, <hi>Ut illic lites terminentur ubi exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae ſunt,</hi> 'tis underſtood of thoſe cauſes, where ſome fact is to be prov'd by witneſſes that live upon the place.</p>
            <p>XIV. The Council was not free. It was call'd by the Pope: And nothing could be determin'd till the Pope ſent his inſtructions from <hi>Rome.</hi> A If any man have a right to convocate the ſupreme Eccleſiaſtical Aſſembly, 'tis certainly He who has from God the ſupreme Eccleſiaſtical power upon earth; and this right, of calling it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains as manifeſtly to the Pope, as the convocation of a Provincial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil belongs to the Metropolitan. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>Scave</hi> ſays. the Princes in the Diet of <hi>Noremberg</hi> deſired<note n="*" place="bottom">p, 31.</note> 
               <hi>that by the Pope with conſent of the Emperour, a free Council should be intimated as ſoon as was poſſible:</hi> he ſays, the Emperour
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:62850:101"/>ſent Letters to the Diet of <hi>Spira,</hi> that<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 34.</note> 
               <hi>he was reſolved to paſs into</hi> Italy, <hi>and to</hi> Rome, <hi>to treat with the Pope, for the calling of a Council:</hi> and afterwards, under <hi>Pius</hi> IV. he ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 304.</note> 
               <hi>all Princes had agreed in demanding it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Second part of your objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; 'Tis certain that, if it had ſtood with the Pope's conveniency, He ought to have been preſent. In his abſence, 'twas neceſſary for the Legates, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting his perſon, to receive frequent directions from him, that they might the better ſupply the want of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. If, for this reaſon, it was lawfull to give them inſtructions before the Council began; why not, afterwards, as long as the Council was ſitting? In fine, whatſoever advice came from <hi>Rome,</hi> Nothing in matter of Doctrine was determin'd, which any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part reſiſted. <hi>Soave</hi> himſelf confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,<note n="*" place="bottom">538.</note> 
               <hi>that it was a general Maxim in this Council, that to eſtablish a Decree of Reformation, a major part of voices was ſufficient; but that a Decree of Faith could not be made if a conſiderable part did contradict.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XV. Many of the Bishops were
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:62850:102"/>Penſioners to the Pope. A. <hi>Soave</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges, that ſeveral<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 116.</note> 
               <hi>of the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops, moved by poverty, made grievous complaints,</hi> &amp; threatned <hi>that they would depart.</hi> If therefore the Pope maintain'd ſome of them, it was a great charity done by him; a good example to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; a thing which formerly uſed to be done by the Emperours. 2. Secular Princes had more money than the Pope; and, if it had been the policy of his Holineſs, they might eaſily have countermin'd it. 3. All the Popes, in their Bulls of Convocation, deſired &amp; exhorted all Secular Princes to ſend as many of their Bishops as poſſibly they could. 4. His Penſioners were not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for him, at leaſt in the Proteſtant Controverſies; &amp; therefore this is no excuſe for the Reformation.</p>
            <p>XVI. In ſome Seſſions, under <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Julius.</hi> there were ſcarce any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Italians.</hi> A. 1. The Council being drawn out from 1545. till 1563. &amp; actually ſitting for about four years, it cannot be rationally expected that any great frequency of Bishops should be continually preſent. 2. The diſorders, cauſed by the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:62850:102"/>by the <hi>Lutherans</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> required their Bishops reſidence to ſecure Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion at home; otherwiſe they would not have been abſent from the Synod. 3. The diſſentions that hapned betwixt the Pope, the Emperour, &amp; King of <hi>France,</hi> and the civil wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Catholicks &amp; Proteſtants, hindred the Bishops, ſometimes of one Nation, ſometimes of another, from attending the Council. 4. All this was fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenc'd, in the third &amp; laſt Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Council, under <hi>Pius</hi> IV.</p>
            <p>XVII. In the end of the Council, we find 187. <hi>Italian</hi> Bishops, and all the reſt make only 83. A. 1. All theſe <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> were not of the Pope's Territory, but a great many of them ſubject to the Emperour, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> &amp; the State of <hi>Venice.</hi> In ſeveral matters they had different inſtructions, &amp; adhered to their divers intereſts, even in oppoſition to the Pope, when the Ambaſſadors of their Princes craved their aſſiſtance. <hi>Soave</hi> tells us,<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 522.</note> 
               <hi>it was publichly ſaid</hi> by the <hi>Papalins</hi> (ſo he is pleas'd to call them) <hi>that</hi> France <hi>had ever pretended to limit the Popo's power, &amp; ſubject it to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous;</hi>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:62850:103"/>and <hi>that this opinion would be follow'd by many</hi> Italians, <hi>who, becauſe</hi> they <hi>cannot, or know not how to make uſe of the preferments of the Court, do envy thoſe that do; beſides thoſe, who are deſirous of novity, they know not why, of whom there ſeem'd to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis no great matter, as to our preſent purpoſe, whether the Pope had all the <hi>Italian</hi> ſuffrages at his beck, or no; becauſe 'tis certain he had no need at all, of any ſuch aſſiſtance in deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Proteſtant controverſies, in which the Bishops, of all nations, unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly agreed. See what <hi>Soave</hi> ſays, concerning the following points.

            <pb n="207" facs="tcp:62850:104"/>
            <p>XVIII. Proxies were not allowed to have deciſive votes. A. 1. There were but ſeven in the Council. 2. They had votes in conſultations, among the reſt. 3. They had no right to a deciſive vote. 4. Were it indifferently allowed, it would encourage Bishops to pretend neceſſity of their abſence.</p>
            <p>XIX. All the Bishops were ſworn to the Pope, before they ſate in Council. A. 1. They never ſwore to vote againſt their judgment: They only ſwore Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical obedience &amp; fidelity to him, that is, ſuch obedience &amp; fidelity as the Canons of former Councils require,<note n="*" place="bottom">Bellarmin, De Concil, <hi>lib. 1. cap. 21.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>as long as he is Pope, and ſo long as he commands thoſe things, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God, &amp; according to the Canons, he can command; but they do not ſwear, that they will not in Council ſay what they think; or that they will not depoſe him, if they convict him of being a Heretick.</hi> 2. An Oath taken in general terms, to defend his Canonical rights, leaves the Council in perfect liberty to examine what is Canonical, &amp; what not. 3. Without the Oath they are ſtrictly bound, by the Canons, to the ſame obedience &amp; fidelity; ſo that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62850:105"/>it induces no new obligation, but only confirms what was their duty before. 4. Parliament-men ſwearing ſidelity to their King, according to the Laws, do not looſe the freedom of their Vote, nor the power of changing many Laws, &amp; making others, with the King's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. 5. Every Bishop in the English Church, at his conſecration, ſweare due obedience to his Archbishop &amp; his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors: Why may not Catholick Bishops ſwear as much obedience to the Pope? And what harm is there, if they take the very ſame Oath again, before they ſit in Council?</p>
            <p>XX. In one of the Congregations the Bishop of <hi>Guadice</hi> was interrupted &amp; affronted; and the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> complain'd, the Council was not free. A. This hapned only once, &amp; ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was preſently given <hi>Soave</hi> relates it thus.<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 593.</note> 
               <hi>The Bishop of</hi> Guadice <hi>ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the laſt</hi>

               <hi>Canon, where it was determin'd, that Bishops call'd by the Pope are true &amp; lawfull,</hi> ſaid that <hi>there were alſo Bishops, not call'd by the Pope, nor confim'd by him, which nevertheleſs were true &amp; lawfull. For example he brought four Suffragans,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:62850:105"/>elected &amp; ordain'd by the Archbishop of</hi> Salzburg, <hi>who take no confirmation from the Pope. Cardinal</hi> Simoneta <hi>did not ſuffer him to proceed, ſaying, that whatſoever the Arthbishop of</hi> Salzburg <hi>or other Primates did, was all by the Pope's authority. The Bishop of</hi> Cava, <hi>and</hi> two more, <hi>call'd him Schiſmatick,</hi> and <hi>ſaid he ought to be put out of the Council.</hi> Immediatly <hi>there follow'd a great noiſe among the Prelates, as well of whiſpering as of feet, partly in offence of the Prelate that gave his voice, &amp; partly in defence. The Legates did hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeaſe the ſtir, by making others proceed, who were to ſpeak in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; which being ended,</hi> Lorain <hi>ſaid the Bishop had not ſpoken ill.... &amp; indeed it was found that the Bishop had not ſpoken ill, and the Canon was corrected; for whereas it ſaid, the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops call'd by the Pope of</hi> Rome, <hi>it was altered thus; the Bishops aſſumed by the authority of the Pope of</hi> Rome..... Mantua <hi>did alſo reprehend the noiſe made with feet &amp; words, ſaying that, if hereafter they did not ſpeak with reſpect, They,</hi> the Legates, <hi>would go out of the Congregation....</hi> Lorain <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the admonition, &amp; ſaid that as
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:62850:106"/>the Legates ought not to go out of the Congregation, for any occaſion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, ſo it was moſt juſt that the perturbers of it, should be punish'd.</hi> Here you have a full account of the whole matter. It was only a ſuddain heat, &amp; ſoon over. The publick repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion. of thoſe who made a noiſe, was ſatisfaction abundantly ſufficient for what was paſt: And the altering of the Canon, according to the Bishop's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, was a very extraordinary encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement for him, &amp; every body elſe, to ſpeak freely for the future. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal complain'd, before the ſatisfaction was given, &amp; the Canon alter'd, but not after. Beſides, it is not impoſſible for great men to find fault when there is but little reaſon for it. They are uſed to be humour'd, &amp; when they are croſs'd, a ſmall matter is enough for great complaints. I'l give you an inſtance out of <hi>Soave.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 615.</note> Lorain <hi>and</hi> Madruccio <hi>had compoſed a form</hi> concerning <hi>Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> The Legates <hi>approv'd it</hi> at <hi>firſt ſight;</hi> afterwards, <hi>conſulting with the Canoniſts, they diſliked one part.</hi> Lorain <hi>and</hi> Madruccio <hi>were much offended with this mutation, &amp; thought they were
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:62850:106"/>diſparag'd.</hi> Lorain <hi>ſaid, it was not a free Council.</hi> Why was not the Council free? If the <hi>form</hi> which they two had <hi>compoſed,</hi> had been blindly receiv'd without examen; if, out of compliment to them, it had been approv'd <hi>nemine contradicente;</hi> All had been well; The <hi>Council</hi> had been <hi>free</hi> enough: But becauſe ſome others took the liberty to conſider it, &amp; ſpoke their minds freely in contradicting it; therefore <hi>the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil was not free.</hi> Madruccio<note n="*" place="bottom">ibid.</note> 
               <hi>did not forbear to ſay, there was a ſecret Council, within the Council, which did arrogate more authority.</hi> The <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> who examin'd the <hi>form</hi> which they two <hi>had compoſed,</hi> are here call'd a <hi>ſecret Council,</hi> &amp; accuſed of <hi>arrogancy;</hi> not becauſe they aſſumed <hi>more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> but becauſe they pretended to an equal liberty of ſpeaking as freely againſt the <hi>form</hi> as others had ſpoken for it. So prond &amp; ſo ambitious we are, to have our own opinions idoliz'd, and to enlarge the empire of our fancies by enforcing them upon our neighbours; that when we meet with any oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though ever ſo reaſonable, we are ſtreightned for want of room, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:62850:107"/>for want of liberty. So, when <hi>Guzdellun</hi> came to the Council, &amp; had<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 617.</note> 
               <hi>ſeen the paſſages of one day,</hi> he <hi>ſaid, he underſtood plainly the Council was not free.</hi> What theſe paſſages were, <hi>Soave</hi> does not tell us: and, I am ſure, if any thing had hapned contrary to the liberty of the Council, the Relation of it would have been nuts to him. Since therefore your Hiſtorian leaves us to conjecture what we pleaſe; for ought I know, <hi>Guzdellun</hi> might have ſo great an opinion of himſelf, as to imagine, that, when he came to Council, the weight of his reaſons would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently turn'd the ſcale of their delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; that in <hi>one day</hi> he should carry all before him: but afterwards, when he <hi>plainly</hi> ſound his miſtake, and ſaw he could not in <hi>one day</hi> have all things determin'd as he pleas'd, then it was <hi>he underſtood plainly, the Council was not free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXI. In the Hiſtory of the Council we find ſeveral grievous complaints of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Prelates, that they had not their liberty in propoſing &amp; determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>divine right</hi> of <hi>Reſidence.</hi> A. Let us hear their ſeveral complaints in
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:62850:107"/>order, &amp; if you believe your own Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian, you will find they had no reaſon to complain.</p>
            <p n="1">1.<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 474.</note> They <hi>complain'd of the Pope for holding the Council in ſervitude, to which he ought to leave free power to handle &amp; determine all things, and not to meddle himſelf.</hi> A. This laſt clauſe is manifeſtly unreaſonable; Why should not he <hi>meddle</hi> as well as they? Pray, read <hi>Soave,</hi> &amp; ſee in what manner he <hi>meddled</hi> with them.<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 470.</note> 
               <hi>He commended them for ſpeaking according to their Conſcience.... He complain'd of thoſe who referr'd themſelves unto him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Council was aſſembled that every one may deliver his opinion...</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 471.</note> 
               <hi>He was pleas'd that every one should deliver his opinion freely... but ſaid, it was a ſtrange thing, that he who was Head of the Church, and other Prelates, who have voice in Council, may not be inform'd of what is handled, and ſpeak their opinion.. whereas, on the other ſide, it is plain that ſo many Prelates come to</hi> Trent <hi>with commiſſion from their Princes, according to which they proceed; &amp; that the Ambaſſadors by Letters &amp; perſwaſions do compell them
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:62850:108"/>to follow the intereſts of their Maſters, &amp; yet, for all this, no man ſays, that</hi> therefore <hi>the Council is not free. This He amplified with much vehemency,</hi> &amp; certainly with a great deal of reaſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In their Letter to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> They<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 515.</note> 
               <hi>complain'd of the Legates</hi> for not ſuffering <hi>the point</hi> of Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <hi>to be concluded, before they could have</hi> an <hi>anſwer from</hi> Rome.

               <hi>the Prelates did every day take more liberty, not refraining to ſpeak of the Cardinals without reſpect, and with ſmall reverence of his Holineſs: that hereafter it would be hard to keep them in order, becauſe they had many private aſſemblies among themſelves... &amp; that it was not likely they would be ſo bold, without they were upheld, &amp; perhaps incited, by ſome great Prince.</hi> The Pope <hi>conſiderd, that all the Reformation aim'd to reſtrain</hi> his <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, &amp; to enlarge the power of Bishops...</hi> that<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 241.</note>

                     <hi>the Pope reſolv'd that the</hi> Continuation <hi>should be declar'd, let the Emperour do what he could; and diſpatch'd a Currier to</hi> Trent <hi>with this Commiſſion.</hi> If <hi>the Spirit had been wont to move the Legates to think as the Pope did,</hi> why dos <hi>Soave</hi> tell us that, this Commiſſion <hi>being arrived the ſecond of</hi> June, they <hi>all reſolv'd uniformly to inform the Pope better,</hi> &amp; <hi>shew him the impoſſibility to perform his Order?</hi> Why dos he tell us, that <hi>the next day... at night, a Currier came with Letters, that his Holineſs did refer all to the wiſdom &amp; judgment of the Legates?</hi> I might cite you a great deal more, to this purpoſe; but this is enough to shew, 1. that the Legates ſpoke freely their minds, and acted according to their Conſcience; 2. that the Pope did not endeavour to hold the Council in ſervitude.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>XXV. Nothing could be debated but what the Legates propoſed; the Pope's Commiſſions running with this clauſe, <hi>proponentibus Legatis.</hi> A. 1. At leaſt the Council voted freely upon the matters
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:62850:116"/>which were propoſed. 2. In great Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies ſuch a method is neceſſary, to avoid confuſion. 3. It was at length<note n="*" place="bottom">Seſſ <hi>24.</hi> cap. <hi>21.</hi> de Reform.</note> declar'd, that the clauſe was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted with <hi>deſign of changing the uſual methed of treating matters in, General Councils;</hi> and then, <hi>Soave</hi> ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 728.</note> 
               <hi>The difficulty receiv'd an end, with ſatisfaction of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You that have read <hi>Soave,</hi> may eaſily remember a great many paſſages, in which the Prelates over-ruled the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, &amp; forced them to debate things which they had no mind to. 1. This clauſe, <hi>proponentibus Legatis,</hi> was<note n="*" place="bottom">ibid.</note> 
               <hi>much agitated:</hi> 2. The Title of the Council, <hi>Repreſenting the Univerſal Church:</hi> 3. The <hi>divine right</hi> of <hi>Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:</hi> 4. The <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> being <hi>de jure divino:</hi> 5. The general Reformation of the Church: which point might have been pusht perhaps too far, if the Legates had not wiſely counterpoiſed it, with propoſing a ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reformation of Secular Princes. 6. Concerning the grant of the Cup, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Emperour, you read in <hi>Soave,</hi> that<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 530.</note> 
               <hi>the Legates were deſirous to give him ſatisfaction, but could not,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:62850:116"/>becauſe the party of the negative pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd.</hi> 7. About admitting the Proteſtant Divines to diſputation, you find that<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 343.</note> 
               <hi>this opinion was readily embrac'd, firſt by the</hi> Dutch, <hi>then by the</hi> Spanish <hi>Prelates, &amp; at laſt ſomewhat coldly by the</hi> Italians, <hi>the Legate remaining im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, and shewing plainly that he ſtood quiet, being forc'd by neceſſity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Give me leave to add one inſtance more, and if you are not fully ſatisfied with it, I shall know what to think of you. Read <hi>Soave,</hi> p. 498. &amp; 499. and obſerve, 1. how boldly the Bishops of <hi>Veglia</hi> and <hi>Sidonia</hi> ſpoke their minds concerning the corruptions of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; Reformation of the Pope himſelf; 2. how moderately <hi>the Legates &amp; other Papalins</hi> diſcourſed about it, when, <hi>the Congregation being ended, they remain'd in the place together</hi> to conſider the <hi>boldneſs,</hi> &amp; <hi>too much licence,</hi> of the Prelates, in <hi>broaching new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this occaſion <hi>Caſtello,</hi> who had been Speaker under <hi>Julius,</hi> told them that Cardinal <hi>Creſcentius</hi> was uſed <hi>to interrupt them</hi> &amp; <hi>ſometimes impoſe them ſilence.</hi> But the Cardinal of <hi>Varmia</hi> sharply reprehended this practiſe, &amp;
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:62850:117"/>
               <hi>ſaid, that Nothing is more neceſſary to a Chriſtian Synod than Liberty; and that, reading the Councils of the better times, one shall find contentions &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords in the beginnings of them, even in the preſence of the Emperours, which notwithſtanding did, in the end, turn, by the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, into a marvellous concord; and that was the miracle which did pacifie the world. He ſaid, there were infinite contentions in the</hi> Nicene <hi>Council, &amp; moſt exorbitant in the</hi> Epheſine, <hi>and therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if there were now ſome diverſity of opinions civilly carried, which he that would reſiſt by human &amp; violent means, will let the world know that the Council is not free, &amp; take from it all reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that it is good to refer the cauſe unto God, who will govern Councils, &amp; moderate thoſe who are aſſembled in his name. The Cardinal of</hi> Mantua <hi>approv'd</hi> this <hi>opinion, &amp; diſliked the proceeding of</hi> Creſcentius, <hi>but ſaid, it was not contrary to the liberty of the Council to moderate abuſes with Decrees, preſcribing the order &amp; time of ſpeaking, &amp; diſtributing to every one his own part.</hi> This <hi>was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended</hi> by <hi>Varmia,</hi> &amp; <hi>they agreed to give order for it.</hi>

            <pb n="233" facs="tcp:62850:117"/>
            <p>XXVI. Notwithſtanding all this, the Legates would not give leave to propoſe the Article concerning the Inſtitution of Bishops.<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 550.</note> 
               <hi>Granata, Braganza, Meſſina,</hi> &amp; <hi>Segovia,</hi> having <hi>obtain'd audience of the Legates, deſired that they might handle the Articles, that Bishops are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Chriſt, &amp; are Superior to Prieſts</hi> jure divino. <hi>The Legates, after they had conferr'd together, anſwerd, that it was fit to declare, a Bishop is ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, but</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 551.</note> 
               <hi>that it was not neceſſary to ſay,</hi> quo jure. <hi>Granata</hi> replyd, <hi>that there was a Controverſy, and that, if the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines did diſpute it, the neceſſity of deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this point would be known. The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates would not conſent by any means.</hi> A. 1. They did not abſolutely forbid the debating of this matter. 2. After expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the contentions about Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, they could not but foreſee that this diſpute, ſo much connected with the other, might occaſion greater diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, of which they would have been guilty, had they given leave: &amp; therefore they<note n="*" place="bottom">ibid.</note> 
               <hi>would not conſent by any means.</hi> 3. The Divines &amp; Prelates freely took leave, though it was not given them; &amp; never ſpoke more boldly, than they did
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:62850:118"/>upon this ſubject. If you will not believe me, believe your friend <hi>Soave:</hi> Read what follows, &amp; believe your own eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Michael Orencuſpe,</hi> a Divine of the Bishop of <hi>Pampelona,</hi> argued,<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 558.</note> 
               <hi>that howſoever it be true and certain, that Bishops are ſuperior</hi> jure Pontificio, <hi>yet the Lutherans are not in this regard to be condemn'd for Hereticks, becauſe that cannot be an Article of Faith, which is grounded only upon the Law of man.</hi>
            </p>

               <note n="*" place="bottom">ibid.</note>John Fonſeca <hi>a Divine of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of</hi> Granata <hi>follow'd, ſaying, it neither was, nor could be forbidden to ſpeak of it. For the Article being propos'd to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs'd, whether it be heretical or no, it is neceſſary to underſtand whether it be againſt Faith; againſt which it cannot be, if it do not repugn to the Law of God.</hi> He ſaid <hi>that if the Pope be inſtituted by</hi> Chriſt, <hi>becauſe be hath ſaid to</hi> Peter, Feed my Lambs, <hi>Bishops are likewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted</hi> by him, <hi>becauſe he hath ſaid alike to all the Apoſtles,</hi> as my Father hath ſent me, ſo I ſend you. <hi>And, if the Pope be Succeſſor of</hi> S. Peter, <hi>the Bishops are Succeſſors of the</hi> Apoſtles; <hi>which</hi> he prov'd by <hi>many Authorities out of the Fathers. He added, that to be confirm'd
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:62850:118"/>or created by the Pope, did not conclude, that they were not inſtituted by</hi> Chriſt, <hi>or had not authority from him. For the Pope himſelf is created by the Cardinals, and yet hath his authority from</hi> Chriſt: <hi>So the Bishops receive the Dioceſs from the Pope, &amp; authority from</hi> Chriſt, <hi>Their Superiority over Prieſts he prov'd to be</hi> jure divino, <hi>by authority of many Fathers, who ſay that Bishops ſucceed the Apoſtles, &amp; Prieſts the ſeventy two Diſciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Antony Groſſetus <hi>inſiſted upon</hi> the ſame point.<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 559.</note> 
               <hi>He ſaid it was neceſſary to declare, that Bishops have not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, for their Office, from men; for ſo they would be Hirelings, to whom the Lambs do not belong, becauſe the man, who had committed the care unto them, being ſatisfied, they had no more to think on....</hi> In the end, he excuſed himſelf, <hi>that he had ſpoken without premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion...</hi> not remembring that <hi>that point was forbidden to be ſpoke of</hi> Here it is that <hi>Soave</hi> would make us believe, that <hi>Groſſetus</hi> fear'd <hi>ſome bad encounter;</hi> but, I am ſure, if any <hi>bad encounter</hi> had ever hapned to him, upon this account, <hi>Soave</hi> would have taken care to let us know it. Have but a little patience to obſerve how freely &amp; boldly the Bishops deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:62850:119"/>their opinions in the following Congregations, and then I'l give you leave to tell me, if you can, what <hi>bad encounter</hi> they fear'd.</p>
            <p>The Archbishop of <hi>Granata</hi> ſaid,<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 565.</note> 
               <hi>They muſt needs declare both theſe two points, that is, that Bishops are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted</hi> jure divino, <hi>and are</hi> jure divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no <hi>ſuperior to Prieſts: And he confirm'd his opinion at large, with many reaſons, arguments, &amp; authorities... He cited Pope</hi> Eleutherius, <hi>who, in an epiſtle to the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops of</hi> France, <hi>wrote, that</hi> Chriſt <hi>had committed the Church Univerſal to them.</hi> He added, <hi>that</hi> Ambroſe <hi>upon the Epiſtle to the</hi> Corinthians <hi>ſaith, that the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop holdeth the place of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>&amp; is Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car of the Lord...</hi> that <hi>there are extant Epiſtles of</hi> Cyprian <hi>to</hi> Fabianus, Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Lucius, <hi>and</hi> Stephanus, <hi>Popes, where he giveth them the title of Brothers; and of</hi> Auſtin, <hi>written in his own name, &amp; of the Bishops of</hi> Africa, <hi>in which the Popes</hi> Innocentius <hi>and</hi> Bonifacius <hi>are likewiſe call'd Brothers;</hi> &amp;, <hi>which is moſt plain, not only in the Epiſtles of thoſe two Saints, but of many others, the Pope is call'd</hi> Colleague ... that <hi>it is againſt the nature of a Colledge to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of perſons of divers kinds...

               <hi>He jeſted at thoſe Divines who had ſaid, that all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were inſtituted by</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and made equal in authority, but that it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal in them, &amp; ought not to paſs to their Succeſſors, except that of</hi> S. Peter; <hi>asking them, as if they had been preſent, with what ground, authority, or reaſon, they were induced to make ſuch a bold affirmation, invented within theſe fifty years only, expreſsly contrary to the Scripture, in which</hi> Chriſt <hi>ſaid to all the Apoſtles,</hi> I will be with you untill the end of the world, <hi>which words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot be expounded of their particular perſons only, muſt be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily underſtood of the ſucceſſion of all.</hi>

               <hi>The Archbishop of</hi> Braga <hi>prov'd at large, the Inſtitution of Bishops</hi> de jure divino. <hi>He ſaid, that the Pope cannot take
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:62850:120"/>from Bishops the Authority given them in their conſecration, which doth contain in it the power, not only of Order but of Juriſdiction ... that to Titular Bishops a City is allotted, which would not be neceſſary, if the Epiſcopal Order could ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without Juriſdiction.</hi> He was follow'd by the Bishops of <hi>Segovia,</hi> of <hi>Segna,</hi> &amp; others, who ſpoke as boldy as himſelf, not fearing any <hi>bad encounter;</hi> and <hi>Soave</hi> ſays<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 569.</note>

            </p>
            <p>After all this, the Bishop of <hi>Segovia,</hi> when the Prelates met again in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, argued<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 582.</note> 
               <hi>that it was decided in the Congregations under</hi> Julius III. <hi>that Bishops are inſtituted</hi> jure divino; <hi>though</hi> it was <hi>not publisht in Seſſion, by reaſon of the ſuddain diſſolution of the Council...

               <hi>The</hi> French <hi>made proof of their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

               <hi>an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der came from the Emperour to his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, to uſe all means that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Pope should not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs'd in Council; which his Majeſty did, becauſe he ſaw the major part inclined to enlarge it... The Ambaſſadors, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving treated with the Legates in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity hereof, as alſo with</hi> Lorain, <hi>&amp; other principal Prelates, did cauſe this Article to be omitted, as alſo that other of the Inſtitution of Bishops. But firſt they made many conſultations about it, that all might reſt contented.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXIX. Why were the Popes, of thoſe times, ſo afraid of a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil?
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:62850:123"/>Why ſo averſe from it? Why did they, to ſecure themſelves, shift ſides ſo often betwixt the Emperour &amp; King of <hi>France?</hi> A. You might as well have ask'd me, Why dos a Pilot fear a ſtorm? Why is he ſo averſe from it? Why dos he trimm the boat ſo often? S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Ship,</hi> in thoſe days, was grievouſly toſs'd, &amp; almoſt <hi>coverd with the waves:</hi> But our Lord, who ſeem'd to <hi>ſleep,</hi> at length <hi>aroſe,</hi> commanded <hi>the winds &amp; the Sea,</hi> &amp; there follow'd <hi>a great Calm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXX. Why did they avoid, &amp; defer ſo long, the General Reformation? Why were Bulls given ſecretly to the Legates, to ſuſpend or transfer the Council, as occaſion ſerv'd? Why did they open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare, that a Council is ever dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, when the Pope's Authority is queſtion'd? A. You'l never have done with theſe cramp-queſtions, except a man give you as good as you bring. Is not the <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Abuſes,</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> as dangerous as the <hi>Redreſſing</hi> of <hi>Grievances,</hi> in the <hi>State?</hi> If our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were in the ſame ferment, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reign of <hi>Charles</hi> I. would you blame his Majeſty for pretending to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogue or diſſolve as he pleaſes? And have we not, ever ſince, great reaſon to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:62850:123"/>believe that a Parliament (though, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, excellent in it ſelf) is always dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, when the King's Authority is queſtion'd? In thoſe tumults of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiaſtical Affairs, <hi>Reformation</hi> was a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous buſineſs: And, had the Reformers been <hi>let ſlip</hi> at the <hi>Abuſes,</hi> they would perhaps have <hi>worry'd</hi> the whole <hi>Church.</hi> If S. <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>in perils among falſe Brethren,</hi> the Succeſſor of S. <hi>Peter</hi> was no leſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 284.</note> 
               <hi>Not only the Proteſtants did impugn</hi> his <hi>Authority, but many Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alſo would reſtrain it, &amp; many Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops did think to moderate it.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 205.</note> 
               <hi>The Spaniards had a ſecret, which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated only among themſelves, to make great the Epiſcopal Authority, ſo that the Pope could not reſtrain it.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> had<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 532.</note>

               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 349.</note> 
               <hi>The Emperour's Ambaſſadors had given the Proteſtants hope to moderate the Papal Authority, &amp; ſaid that they expected to ſee a Gate laid open by their negotiation, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they might ſecond it:</hi> and <hi>Julius</hi> III. <hi>had intelligence, that the Emperour had a deſign to advance himſelf, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing of the Papacy.</hi> This was enough
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:62850:124"/>to make the Popes, of that Age, take care to look before they leap'd. But yet this was not all, if <hi>Soave</hi> ſays true. The<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Governours of Countries regarded not much, what the Council might deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine concerning Doctrines; but deſired it might be ſuch a one, as might reduce the Prieſts &amp; Friers to their beginning; hoping that by that means the regalities &amp; temporal jurisdictions might return unto them. And therefore they ſaid, it was in vain to call a Council where the Bishops, &amp; other Prelates, only, should have a deliberative voice; becauſe they ought to be reform'd, and it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that others should have the charge thereof, who could not be deceiv'd by their proper intereſts.</hi> Here you ſee, in plain English, what the <hi>Reformation</hi> was like to come to. 1. The deſign was laid to bring the Eccleſiaſticks <hi>to their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:</hi> They were to be brought to their <hi>Staff</hi> and <hi>Scrip</hi> again, &amp; ſent about their buſineſs, whilſt the Reformers plonder'd the Church, &amp; divided the ſpoiles. 2. To do it with more eaſe, <hi>it was in vain to call a Council of Bishops,</hi> but the Laity were to <hi>have the charge thereof, who could not be deceiv'd by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per intereſts.</hi> This Reaſon, I confeſs, if
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:62850:124"/>it had taken place, would have been worth it's weight in gold: but, pray, give me leave to make the caſe your own. Suppoſe a man should demand your purſe; and, upon refuſal, tell you He is the better Judge, whether or no you ought to deliver; becauſe your intereſt blinds you, but He <hi>cannot be deceiv'd by his praper intereſt.</hi> Would you believe this honeſt Gentleman? How did you like this method of <hi>Reforming,</hi> when our English Rebels threw the <hi>Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> out of doors, &amp; the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> out of the windows? Did you fancy that thoſe <hi>Church-and-State-Menders</hi> deſerv'd <hi>to have the charge of</hi> thoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that <hi>it was neceſſary</hi> they <hi>should have</hi> it, becauſe they <hi>could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by their proper intereſts?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If ſuch a Throughout-Reformation as this, had been effectually procured, All had been well: Complaints would then have ceas'd, becauſe there would have been nothing left to complain of: The Reformers would have <hi>reduced</hi> the Pope, the Cardinals, the Bishops Prieſts &amp; Friers, <hi>to their beginning,</hi> which in plain English is little better than <hi>reducing</hi> them <hi>to their end:</hi> The Faction would then have triumph'd, according to their hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire;
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:62850:125"/>juſt as our Rebels did, when they had brought our Monarchy to it's <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi> by beheading of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But, this not being effected, All the reſt was nothing to the purpoſe. One would think that eleven or twelve De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, containing above 140. chapters of Reformation, might be ſome degree of ſatisfaction to any reaſonable men: But, when people are diſappointed in their principal deſign, right or wrong 'tis all the ſame, they are out of humour; and, when they are ſo, tis a hard matter to pleaſe them. This was the reaſon why the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Criticks were ſo sharp in cenſuring &amp; ridiculing the Decrees, as ſoon as each Seſſion of the Council was publish'd in <hi>Germany.</hi> p. 504. <hi>The Birth of the Mountains,</hi> was a proverb much in vogue, which <hi>Soave</hi> has recorded in more places than one, though otherwiſe worded, <hi>The travail of the mountains, and the nativity of the mouſe:</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion proper enough to let us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, what vaſt projects they had laid of <hi>reducing</hi> all things <hi>to their beginning;</hi> &amp; how much they were diſappointed in them; ſince what was decreed by the Council, compar'd with what they would have done themſelves, was no
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:62850:125"/>more than a <hi>mouſe</hi> to a <hi>mountain.</hi> In the ſame page, he goes on; <hi>Concerning the Reformation it was ſaid, that more light points could not be handled, nor more lightly; and that they did imitate the Phyſician, who, in a hectical body, laboured to kill the Itch.</hi> This was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleaſant jeſt, which <hi>Soave</hi> took care of, for fear it should be loſt. But, let him jeſt as he pleaſes, the <hi>Itch,</hi> he talks of, is not ſo eaſily cured. This humour, of Reforming, is a very <hi>itching</hi> humour: And the <hi>Itch</hi> is a ſtrange reſtleſs diſeaſe: Even the wiſer ſort of mankind, when they have once got it, cannot for their lives forbear <hi>Scratching,</hi> though they know by experience that it dos more harm than good.</p>
            <p>Read the Decrees of Reformation from the beginning to the end, and if you read them with a ſerious attention, I am very confident, an impartial man, as you are, will not ſay they are, either <hi>light,</hi> or <hi>lightly handled.</hi> If you have the <hi>Council</hi> in your Library, I had rather you would read them there, than in <hi>Soave;</hi> who, I muſt needs tell you, is not ſo exact as I could wish him. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of relating the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> he leaves out a great many circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:62850:126"/>which a curious man would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to know: And beſides, although I have compar'd a very ſmall part of his tranſlation with the original, I find ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral miſtakes in it. p. 503. n. 1. he reads <hi>is,</hi> for <hi>is not.</hi> p. 692. n. 12. he reads <hi>ſix,</hi> for <hi>five.</hi> p. 733. n. 2. he reads <hi>two,</hi> for <hi>three.</hi> p 753. n. 1. of two expreſs <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> he has made only one <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</hi> Such negligences as theſe are enough to make me ſuſpect him in other matters; &amp; are a great argument that it was more his buſineſs, to find fault with the Reformation, than to give an exact account of it. But, whether you conſult the <hi>Council</hi> or his <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> that you may find out all the Decrees in order, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any trouble, I have directed you to all the <hi>Seſſions</hi> of the one, &amp; <hi>pages</hi> of the other.

               <hi>that the Canons shall be obſerved [exactly &amp;] in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinctly by all, &amp; shall not be diſpenſed, but for [an urgent and juſt] cauſe, heard with [great] maturity, &amp; without coſt [by whoſoere they are, to whom it appertains: Otherwiſe, the Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall be judg'd Surreptitious.]</hi> If the <hi>Cauſe</hi> be, not only <hi>juſt</hi> but <hi>urgent;</hi> if the <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>urgency</hi> be well <hi>known</hi> before the grant of it; if nothing be given to any <hi>whoſoever</hi> for it; Such a Diſpenſation is unqueſtionably blameleſs. And now, I deſire to know, How was it poſſible for the Council to provide more effectually for the punctual obſervance of all theſe three conditions, than by declaring that <hi>otherwiſe</hi> the <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> is, &amp; shall be, <hi>ſurreptitious,</hi> &amp; of no effect?</p>
            <p>XXXI. In the end of the Council, there
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:62850:130"/>was great joy in Rome, for having chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the world, and advanced their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, where they fear'd to have their wings clipp'd. A. Here I know not how you'l be able to make the two ends of <hi>Soave</hi>'s Hiſtory meet. In his firſt book, he talks much at this rate; and, in his laſt, he largely contradicts it. He tells us, in the end, how the Pope and Cardinals delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated upon the matter, whether or no the Decrees of Reformation, were to be confirmed; And ſays, that<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 759.</note> 
               <hi>the Court, underſtanding that the Pope was reſolved upon the Confirmation, chang'd their joy into grief; All the Officers complain'd of the loſſes they should receive in their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if that Reformation were executed... Supplications alſo, &amp; Memorials, were given to the Pope, by thoſe, who, having bought their Offices, &amp; foreſeeing this loſs, demanded reſtitution... The Pope having diligently conſider'd thereof, deputed eight Cardinals to conſult upon the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; &amp; to think upon ſome remedies for the complaints of the Court...</hi> He concludes, <hi>It is certain, that they who did procure the Council, had no aim but to pull down the Pope's Authority; And, while the Council did laſt, every one did ſpeak, as if it had power to give Laws to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After all, you think to mortifie me
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:62850:130"/>with objecting, that the corruptions of the <hi>Court,</hi> &amp; the abuſes tolerated in the <hi>Church,</hi> are at great as ever. But you muſt give me leave to tell you, 1. I am not obliged to take your bare word for't; 2. Whether it be true or falſe, 'tis nothing to my preſent purpoſe. If falſe, you are to blame for ſaying ſo: If true, 'tis none of the Council's fault. Having proceeded legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; having made good Laws, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil has done its part: 'tis ours, to do the reſt. My buſineſs is to defend the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil: I have nothing to do, to rake the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill of the Church. Has the <hi>Decalogue</hi> leſs Authority, becauſe the greateſt part of mankind are ſo diſobedient? Or is the <hi>Ghoſpel</hi> leſs Sacred, becauſe there are ſo few who live according to the maxims of it? If this be the onely reaſon, why you Proteſt againſt the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Decrees of Reformation are not every where, in all things, punctually obſerv'd; I ſee no reaſon, why you may not, with as good a grace, Proteſt againſt the <hi>Ghoſpel,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Ten Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now done with your Objections: And although I am not of the Poet's mind, that <hi>Brevity is always good, be it, or be it not, underſtood;</hi> Yet I have endeavour'd to be as short as poſſibly I could, becauſe, when I deal with a man of your parts, a
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:62850:131"/>word is enough to the wiſe, &amp; few words are beſt.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Soave,</hi> whom you ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, I deſire to ask you a few queſtions, before I tell you what I think of him. Suppoſe a mortal enemy of yours should <hi>Libel</hi> you, by the way of <hi>Hiſtory;</hi> call you <hi>Rogue</hi> &amp; <hi>Raſcal</hi> in the very Preface; and, at the ſame time, perſwade his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he <hi>follows exactly the truth:</hi> Would you have me take this Author for an Oracle? Would you not think me rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, if I ſuſpected almoſt every word he ſaid? And ought not I to do the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> as much Juſtice, as I would my <hi>Friend?</hi> Tis certain that <hi>Soave</hi> was a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal enemy of the Council: In the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, he declares it: He ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 2.</note> 
               <hi>it has cauſed the greateſt deformation that ever was,</hi> &amp; calls it <hi>the Iliad of the Age;</hi> which is as kind a compliment to the Fathers, as if he had call'd them, a pack of <hi>Villains.</hi> He tells us indeed, in the ſame place, that he is <hi>not poſſeſs'd with any paſſion, which may make him erre;</hi> and this was well enough ſaid; But how shall a body do to believe him? If it were your own caſe, I'm ſure you would not like my being credulous: And how do I know but that an Enemy of the Council
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:62850:131"/>may deſerve as little credit, as an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of yours?</p>
            <p>Another reaſon, why I do not like him, is becauſe he takes upon him to write men's private thoughts, with as much aſſurance as he writes their words and actions. He hardly ever ſpeaks of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> but he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains his Reader with a pleaſant Scene, in which he brings the Pope alone upon the Stage, diſcourſing with himſelf his ſecret apprehenſions &amp; deliberations upon every matter; ſuch thoughts as no wiſe man would truſt his neighbour with, although he were the beſt &amp; ſureſt friend he had in the world. How <hi>Soave</hi> could poſſibly come to any certain knowledg of ſuch things, I am not able to comprehend: And truly, if a man, in one caſe, will tell me more than he <hi>can</hi> know; I have juſt reaſon to be afraid that, in another, he'l tell me more than he <hi>dos</hi> know.</p>
            <p>A third reaſon, which weighs more with me than all the reſt, is this: You tell me, on the one ſide, He was a <hi>Popish Frier;</hi> And, on the other, I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but that (although perhaps, for ſome reaſons, he did not openly profeſs it) He was really a <hi>Proteſtant.</hi> It appears ſo plainly, by his cenſuring the Decrees of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> as well as thoſe of <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:62850:132"/>&amp; by the ſevere reflections of his own, which he intermixes with thoſe of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Criticks; that I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how any man of ſenſe, who reads him with attention, can be of another opinion. Had he been a barefaced Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, I should be more inclined to believe him. There is ſomething of integrity &amp; honour in a man that openly profeſſes what he is: And, although paſſion &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice may blind him, yet I am apt to think that ſuch a perſon will never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me, more than he deceives himſelf. But a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> that lives &amp; dies in the profeſſion of a <hi>Popish Frier,</hi> How can I believe his <hi>words,</hi> when the moſt ſerious of his <hi>actions</hi> are only ſo many lies? For my own part, I would as ſoon make choice of a <hi>Catholick Jew</hi> to comment upon the Ghoſpel, &amp; to write the life of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as I would chooſe a <hi>Proteſtant Frier</hi> to write the Hiſtory of a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I end my Letter, give me leave, once more, to mind you of the Diſcourſe we had, when we ſaw one another laſt. We both agreed, that<note n="*" place="bottom">C. II. p. 1.</note> 
               <hi>it were a very irrational thing to make Laws for a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, &amp; leave it to the inhabitants to be the Interpreters &amp; Judges of thoſe Laws; for then every man will be his own Judge,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:62850:132"/>&amp; by conſequence no ſuch thing as either Right or Wrong:</hi> that<note n="*" place="bottom">ibid.</note> 
               <hi>therefore we cannot ſuppoſe, that God Almighty would leave us at thoſe Uncertainties, as to give us a Rule to go by, &amp; leave every man to be his own Judge:</hi> that<note n="*" place="bottom">ib.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſt left his Spirit &amp; Power to his Church, by which they were the Judges, even of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf, many years after the Apoſtles, which Books were Canonical, &amp; which were not:</hi> that<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>ibid.</hi> p. 2.</note> 
               <hi>the Judgment of the Church, is without Appeal; otherwiſe, what they decide would be no farther to be follow'd than it agrees with every man's private Judgment:</hi> that <hi>becauſe, in the Apoſtles Creed, we believe in the Holy Catholick Church, therefore we ought to believe in the firſt four General Councils, which were true &amp; legal Repreſentatives of it:</hi> And laſtly, that <hi>if the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>were prov'd to be as General, as free, &amp; as legal in all it's circumſtances, as any of the firſt four Councils were; then you muſt needs own your ſelf obliged in Conſcience to ſubmit to it, &amp; to leave of Proteſting againſt it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This laſt part I have here endeavour'd to prove, out of <hi>Soave</hi> himſelf, your own Hiſtorian, who always makes the worſt of things, &amp; never ſpeaks a favourable
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:62850:133"/>word, but when the Power of Truth conſtrains him to it. If I have not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd according to expectation; 'tis your own fault, who are to blame for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a better opinion of me than I deſerve. I am no Doctor, nor Graduate; but every way unfit to be a Champion of the Cauſe. Yet, having receiv'd your Commands, I have juſt reaſon to expect, that you will eaſily pardon a man, who in this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is guilty of no other crime than being ready to shew himſelf,</p>
